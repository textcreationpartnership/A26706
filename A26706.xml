            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The words of the Text are an entire Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which may be logically reſolved into, 1. <hi>A Subject,</hi> [the Man that feareth] together with

the Circumſtances of time [alway]. 2. An <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute,</hi> or ſomething affirmed concerning this Man [happy], he is an happy Man.</p>

            <p>[Happy] or bleſſed, or as it is in the Original, O the bleſſedneſs, O how bleſſed! he is a very happy Man, <hi>[the Man that feareth]</hi> that is, ſay ſome, The Man that feareth all the evil that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; the miſery that is before him, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that he is in.

            <p>In the opening hereof, I ſhall more particularly enquire,

                  <item>1. <hi>What that Fear is, to which Bleſſedneſs is pronounced.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>What that Bleſſedneſs is, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to this Fear.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>In the handling whereof, I ſhall together give in the proof of the Doctrine.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>What that Fear is to which Bleſſedneſs is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced.</hi> There is a Fear that is our <hi>weakneſs;</hi> As, 1. the Fear of the <hi>faint-hearted,</hi> a natural puſillanimity or cowardize; there are ſuch weak Spirits in whom every little danger, or but the ſhadow of a danger, ſhakes their Hearts, and puts them into anxieties and diſquiets. In what perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual bondage do ſome timerous Spirits live! how reſtleſs are their hearts, like the troubled Sea that cannot be at reſt, every little guſt raiſes a ſtorm! In what a daily and hourly ſucceſſion of vexing diſquiets do they live! 2. The Fear of the <hi>Scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,</hi> about ſome ſuppoſed moral Evils which concern their practice; who through weakneſs of Underſtanding, or the abounding of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, do often fancy that to be Sin which is no Sin, and thereby fright themſelves off from the uſe of their Liberty, and ſometimes from their very Duty. Every Morſel that they eat, every Garment that they wear, they are afraid leſt it be too much, or too good, or too fine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and thereby ſcruple themſelves out of their convenient
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103224:7"/>
Food, and all comely Apparel. Some poor Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick Chriſtians dare not pray; for fear of taking the Name of God in vain: dare not come to the Table of the Lord at all, for fear of coming unworthily.</p>
            <p>In this Fear there is a mixture of Good and Evil; there's ſomething Good, an averſion from Sin, and tenderneſs of running into it; and there's ſomething evil, a ſinful miſtake, counting that evil which is not evil; as we may not call Evil Good, ſo neither may we call Good Evil; this weakneſs, as it is evil ſo it is miſchievous too, it leads us into Sin; we may ſometimes ſin for fear of Sin, and it brings us into Bondage; we may ſay concerning this fear of Sin, as the Apoſtle doth concerning the fear of Death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.15. There are ſome, <hi>who through fear of</hi> [Sin] <hi>are all their life time ſubject to Bondage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the two, it's much a leſs evil than the other extream; better a ſcrupulous Conſcience than a diſſolute Conſcience; better ſtrain at a Gnat than ſwallow a Camel; there's leſs danger in being frighted at a Bug-bear, than not afraid of a Bear; whatever there be in Nicety, it's a vertue in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of Licentiouſneſs! yet this Fear, this ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs &amp; miſtaken Fear, is an evil and to be ſuppreſſed.</p>
            <p>There is a Fear which is Mens great <hi>wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> a Fear of Religion and Righteouſneſs; a Fear of the Labours and Severities of Religion, and of thoſe Sufferings it may expoſe them to. Sometimes Men Fear the <hi>Yoke of Chriſt;</hi> they dare not be his Diſciples, his Yoke they doubt will be too heavy for their Necks. To be tied up ſo ſhort from every Sin, from all their Carnal Liberties and Pleaſures to be held ſo cloſe to painful Duty, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103224:7"/>
to ſuch conſtant Duty, the foreſight of it ſcares them back from Chriſt, they dare not be his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. I would be a Chriſtian, but I am afraid how I ſhall ever be able to bear his Yoke.</p>
            <p>But moſtly they Fear the <hi>Croſs of Chriſt;</hi> they have heard what Chriſt expects, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.24. <hi>If any will come after me, let him take up his Croſs;</hi> and they ſee that it ſo falls out, that no ſooner is the Yoke taken upon the Neck, but the Croſs is preſently laid on upon the Back. He that will be a ſincere Chriſtian muſt be a ſuffering Chriſtian. <hi>All that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus muſt ſuffer Perſecution,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.12. Muſt they ſo? Then ſerve Chriſt who dare for me. They dare not be Followers of the Lamb, for fear of being a prey to the Wolves.</p>
            <p>There is a Fear which is <hi>Mens Puniſhment;</hi> the Fear of the Guilty, a guilty Heart is a terror to it ſelf, a <hi>Magor-miſſabib,</hi> Fear round about, and makes almoſt every thing elſe a terror to it. Prov. 28.1. <hi>The wicked flee when no Man purſues,</hi> his guilt ſtill dogs him at the heels, the terrors of the Lord fall on him, and horror and aſtoniſhment take hold of him. All theſe Fears are mens miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and it may be ſaid, with reſpect to theſe, <hi>Happy is the Man that never feareth.</hi>] But what is the Bleſſed Fear? or, what is there in it? In ſhort it is this,] <hi>It is ſuch on averſation of the Heart from all manner of future Evils, whether of Sin or of Miſery, which we apprehend our ſelves in danger of, as puts the Soul upon making the beſt Proviſion it can for its ſecurity againſt them.</hi>] The <hi>Matter</hi> or Object of this Fear is Sin, together with all the Fruits of it. The <hi>Form</hi> or proper Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it, is an averſion, or ſtarting back, or
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103224:8"/>
ſhrinking in from it. The <hi>Effect</hi> of it, is to put the Soul to its ſhifts for its own ſecurity againſt it.</p>
            <p>There are implyed or included in it theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>There is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding in it.</hi> Pſal. 111.10. <hi>The fear of God is the beginning of Wiſdom; a good <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding have they that do it.</hi> They are wiſe and underſtanding Men that Fear. As we Love not, ſo neither do we Fear, but whom or what we have ſome apprehenſion of; our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons follow our Apprehenſions; as our <hi>Love</hi> (we cannot love but what we apprehend to be good) ſo our <hi>Fear,</hi> we cannot fear but what we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend to be evil. Our miſtakes are the ground of the inordinate workings of our Affections; when we apprehend that to be good which is not good, we love what we ſhould not love; when we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that to be evil which is not evil, we fear what we ſhould not fear; when we apprehend that to be good which is evil, we love what we ſhould fear; and when we apprehend that to be evil which is good, we fear what we ſhould love.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of our ſinful Fear is our Ignorance. Ignorance both cauſes us to fear when we ſhould not, and leaves us without fear of what we ſhould fear.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Ignorance is the reaſon why we fear what we ſhould not.</hi> How is it that there is ſo much Fear of Men in the World? Why, it is, becauſe we underſtand them not; what a vain thing, what a weak thing they are, how ſhort their power is, and how little 'tis that Man can do.</p>
            <p>Did we know more, how great the Power of God is, how terrible the Wrath of God is, ſure
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103224:8"/>
there would be more fear of God in the World: And did we know how little there is in the Power of Man, and in the Wrath of Man, we ſhould eaſe our ſelves of much of that Carnal Fear which now torments our Spirits. Iſa. 2.22. <hi>Ceaſe ye from Man, whoſe Breath is in his Noſtrils, for wherein is he to be accounted of?</hi> [Ceaſe ye from Man] as from truſting in him, ſo from fearing him, [for wherein is he to be accounted of?] How little is it that he can do for or againſt you? There's little help in him, and there's little hurt that he can do. Men pretend to be great, and make great boaſts of their Power. So did <hi>Pilate</hi> to Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 19.10. <hi>Knoweſt thou not that I have power to Crucifie thee, and I have power to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe thee?</hi> What, art thou ſo ſullen and ſo ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born that thou wilt not ſpeak to me? Conſider Man the Power of Liberty and Bonds, the Power of Life and Death are in my hands. Doſt thou not know me? Yes I know thee well enough, ſayes Chriſt; <hi>Thou haſt no Power but what is given thee,</hi> and therefore limited thee <hi>from Above.</hi> It's for thoſe that know thee not to fear thee, I know thee well enough.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Mens Ignorance is the reaſon why they fear not what they ſhould fear.</hi> Why is it that the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fear not S n? O it's becauſe they know it not. Pſal. 14.4. <hi>Have the workers of Iniquity no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg?</hi> Sure enough they have none, for <hi>they eat up my People as they eat Bread;</hi> ſuch Morſels would ſcald their Mouths, they would not dare to be ſuch Perſecutors and Deſtroyers of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, they would be afraid to touch them if they did but know what they did.</p>
            <p>How bold are Sinners upon Sin? How ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103224:9"/>
do they run on? They Lie, they Swear, they commit Adultery, they Covet, they Defraud, they Oppreſs, they Perſecute. But how is it that they are not afraid to do thus? O! they know not what they do.</p>
            <p>They are the Men of Underſtanding, that Fear to tranſgreſs. Chriſtians, thoſe whoſe Minds are enlightned, dare not do as others do; they ſee what Sin is, they ſee it to be an unclean thing, odious and abominable in the ſight of God; they ſee it to be a dangerous and deadly thing. They <hi>know God,</hi> and thereby underſtand Sin, which is contrary to him. They know <hi>the kindneſs of God, and the terrors of the Lord,</hi> and ſee that Sin is an unworthineſs, and abuſing of kindneſs, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliging of goodneſs, that makes a forfeit of the Divine Love, and expoſes to his Wrath and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation.</p>
            <p>They know <hi>the worth of a Soul;</hi> they have learn'd from their Lord, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.26. that the whole World is not a price for it, neither ſufficient to be its Ranſom, nor to recompence its loſs. They live in the Inviſible World, and have taken a view both of that life which is the reward of the Righteous, and of that Death which is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of the Sinners.</p>
            <p>They ſee that Sin is the loſs and the death of the Soul, the only poiſon that can kill that immortal part; by this alone Immortality is ſwallowed up of Death. They underſtand that ſin, as it is <hi>the Worm</hi> that gnaweth at the root of all their hopes for hereafter, ſo it is <hi>the Wormwood</hi> which imbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters all their Comforts here; this is the Ruſt that cats out all their Treaſures, the Moth that frets out all their Garments, the Stain that marrs all
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103224:9"/>
their Beauty: In fine, this is it that hath fill'd the World with vanity and vexation of Spirit, and Hell with torment. And hence it is that they fear it and fly from it. Doſt thou not fear Sin? Sure thou doſt not know it. O what a light thing doth the World make of it to ſin againſt God! how open do our hearts lie to it! how eaſily doth it beſet us! we are ſurpriz'd by it every day and hour, Sin lies at the door, lies in wait for us; in our Fields, in our Houſes, at our Tables, in our Cloſets; and how often doth it take us and carry us away for Captives? and ſtill we make nothing of it; neither feeling the miſchief it has done us, nor fearing thoſe ruines which it is further bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon us. We can talk of the evil of Sin, of the folly of it, of the filthineſs of it, but we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tremble at it; ſure we do not know it, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we talk. The World would be all up in Arms againſt this Enemy, or elſe betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their heels, running away from it, were it throughly underſtood.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>There is Faith in this Fear.</hi> It is but little that we can ſee of the evil of Sin; our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings at the beſt have much dimneſs upon them; the weakneſs of our ſight is helped out by Faith. Faith helps us to ſee with God's Eyes, it looks on all things as God looks on them. The Lord hath told us what he ſees in Sin, what a Snare it is, what a Serpent it is, what a Plague it is, and what a Womb it is, big with all manner of Miſeries and Miſchiefs, which it's bringing forth upon us. God's Mouth is Eyes to Faith; by Faith we underſtand that it is even as it hath been told us of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Faith helps us to a preſent view of Sin, and to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103224:10"/>
a foreſight of all that is behind; of all thoſe Floods that this Serpent is caſting out of his Mouth to devour the Soul; that Woe and that Wrath it's bringing upon Sinners, both here and hereafter. Future Evils that depend not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily on certain Cauſes, are no otherwiſe clearly to be diſcerned but by the Eye of Faith. And from this Faith this Fear ariſes; as the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13. <hi>We have believed and therefore have we ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;</hi> ſo may it alſo be ſaid, We have believed and therefore fear. Heb. 11.7. <hi>[By Faith]</hi> Noah <hi>being warned of God of things not ſeen as yet, was moved with Fear.</hi> Sinner, art thou yet ſecure? is the Evil of Sin yet unſeen by thee? and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is it but a light thing to thee? Canſt thou make a mock of Sin? Canſt thou make a ſport of Sin? canſt thou take thy reſt in Sin, and make a Tuſh at that Wrath that Sin is bringing upon thee? Believe God; What is it that the Lord hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of it? God ſayes, It is an <hi>evil and bitter thing,</hi> Jer. 2.19. <hi>A Root bearing Gall and Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> Deut. 29.18. Like that Star which fell from Heaven, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.11. whoſe <hi>Name was Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> and which turned the Waters into Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, of which Men died becauſe they were ſo bitter. God ſays, It is <hi>an heavy thing</hi> which hath brought the whole Creation into Bondage, under which it groaneth and travelleth in pain, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.22. God ſayes, <hi>The Soul that ſinneth ſhall die,</hi> Ezek. 18.20. Though the Devil ſayes, He ſhall not die; though Mens hearts ſay, It is a matter of nothing; and becauſe it is a common thing, count it but a very ſmall thing, and can flout at others Fears. Yet God ſayes, They are Fools that make a mock of Sin, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14 19. And God ſayes
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103224:10"/>
thus, not only concerning ſome particular Sins, the moſt notorious, and thoſe of the deepeſt die, Murthers, Adulteries, Blaſphemies; the World will ſay the ſame of theſe, He that doth ſuch things is worthy of death. But God ſpeaks it of Sin <hi>in Specie,</hi> the whole kind of it, little or great, the leaſt ſinful words, even vain words, the leaſt ſinful thoughts; yea, even of Sin <hi>in ſemine,</hi> the inward brood and ſpawn of Sin that lies in the heart, the evil diſpoſitions and inclinations of the Soul, which have not broken forth into Act; the word is general; Rom. 6.23. <hi>The wages of Sin is Death.</hi> Believe God, believe and tremble.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>There is Love in it.</hi> This Fear hath love ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the bottom of it, from whence it ariſes; both the <hi>love of God</hi> and goodneſs, and that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and innocent <hi>ſelf-love</hi> which God hath plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in us, and it is not our Sin but our Duty to maintain.</p>
            <p>There is a Fear concerning which the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 John 4.18. <hi>Perfect Love caſteth out Fear;</hi> but of this it may be ſaid, ſincere Love worketh Fear. Fear is Love's Servant, whoſe Office it is to preſerve what and whom we love, from being offended, hurt, or loſt. He that loves, will fear to loſe or grieve, what and whom he loves. Doſt thou love God? thou wilt fear how thou diſpleaſe or offend God. Doſt thou love thy Soul? thou wilt fear to loſe it. As in good things temporal, Doſt thou love thy Friend? thou wilt fear to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige him. Doſt thou love thine Eſtate, or thy Name, or thy Health? thou wilt fear what-ever may prejudice thee in them. So in good things Spiritual, our Love will ſet our Fear to be a guard about them. It cannot be, but where there's
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103224:11"/>
Love and an hazard of loſing what we love, there will be Fear.</p>
            <p>Sinners are without Fear about the Matters of God and of their Souls. Tell them of loſing God, they fear it not; Why ſo? Why if they do, they love not God ſo well, but they can ſpare him well enough. Tell them of the danger of diſpleaſing and offending God; It moves them not, they bear him no ſuch good will as to fear to grieve him. An upright and honeſt Heart, and a good Conſcience, they have no ſuch regard to it, as thence to be withdrawn from any courſe that may hinder or deprive them of it.</p>
            <p>'Tis to little purpoſe to reaſon thus with them. Take heed of Sin, 'twill rob thee of thy God, 'twill defile thy Conſcience, 'twill diſgrace thy Profeſſion, 'twill break thy Peace: This hath lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle weight with them, nor ever will, till they have more love for Spiritual Things.</p>
            <p>'Twill hardly move them to tell them, your Souls will be loſt, farewel to all your hopes of everlaſting Life, if you take not heed of Sin; they love their Luſts better than their Souls.</p>
            <p>They love this World, they love their Money, and their Eaſe, and their Carnal Liberty; and hereby it appears they do, they are afraid of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may prejudice them in theſe things. In times of Perſecution for Righteouſneſs-ſake, they Fear Religion as the Devil, they Fear Holineſs more than Hell, they dare not be Godly for fear their Righteouſneſs ſhould be their ruine.</p>
            <p>Our Love ſets all our Affections on work. What we love, if it be abſent, we deſire it; if it be poſſible to be had, we hope for it; if we have it, we joy; if we loſe it, we grieve; if we
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103224:11"/>
be in danger of loſing it, we Fear.</p>
            <p>Friend, Thou ſayeſt thou loveſt God, thy Soul, a good Conſcience; what; and in ſuch daily dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of loſing all, and yet art not afraid? Thou ſayeſt thou loveſt not the World; thou haſt an Eſtate in the World, and art eagerly hunting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more, and wilt make any ſhift thou canſt to ſecure and increaſe it, but yet thou hopeſt thou doſt not ſet thy heart upon it; But why then art thou ſo often in Fears? Thou art afraid of Chriſt, afraid of Conſcience, thou dar'ſt not be an open Diſciple, a bold Profeſſor, becauſe thou knoweſt not what it may coſt thee; and doſt thou yet ſay thou loveſt not the World? Thy fear, Man, of what thou thinkeſt will prejudice thy worldly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, this Fear is a ſign thou loveſt.</p>
            <p>The Saints Fear Sin, yea and all temptations to it: Why ſo? O 'tis becauſe they love their God and their Souls.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>There is in it an averſation from evil, both from Sin, and all the Fruits of Sin.</hi> The three former Particulars, are the cauſes of this Fear, but this is in the Nature of it. The Underſtanding diſcovers ſin, 1. <hi>To be an Evil,</hi> a corruptive Evil, that will defile and pollute the Soul; a deſtructive Evil, that will undoe and deſtroy it. 2. <hi>To be an evil hardly to be eſcaped.</hi> It ſees the Soul to be in danger of it every day and every hour; Evil as Evil, is not the Object of Fear, but Evil that we are in danger of. Evil as Evil, is the Object of Hatred, not ſo of Fear; there's no Fear of Sin in Heaven, becauſe there's no danger of it. To hear of the Plague, or Sword, or Famine, or Earthquakes, or Fire in the <hi>Indies,</hi> or any other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote parts of the World, this doth not move

Fear, it's far enough off us we are in no danger of it. But when the Plague is in the Town, when the next Houſe is on Fire, then we are ſtartled. 3. <hi>To be an Evil not to be endured,</hi> an intolerable Evil: Hereupon the Heart ſhrinks back from it, and is in pain, till it can be ſecured againſt it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>There is foreſight in it.</hi> Fear is of future Evil, apprehended to be coming on; <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.3. <hi>A prudent Man foreſeeth the Evil.</hi> This prudent Man is the very ſame with this fearing Man, as appears by the next words, <hi>[and hideth himſelf]</hi> 'tis Fear that makes Men hide.</p>

            <p>He that Fears God, ſees what's out of ſight to the blear-ey'd World.

            <p>James 1.15. <hi>Luſt when it hath conceived bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth Sin, and Sin when it is finiſhed bringeth forth Death.</hi> What is there in a Thought? What is there in a Luſt, or an evil Motion? Who would fright himſelf with Fancies ſaith the Pur-blind World? I, but what will this Thought or this Luſt bring forth? Who knows, ſaith the Fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Soul, what a numerous Brood may ſpring
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103224:12"/>
forth out of this pregnant Womb? Luſt when it hath conceived brings forth Sin; any Sin, the worſt that can be imagined, multitudes of Sins, all manner of Iniquities. Luſt will bring forth Sin, and what will Sin bring forth? Why, Sin when it is finiſhed bringeth forth Death. A pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Man foreſeeth all this, ſees Sin's laſt in its firſt, its Fruits in its Root; he ſees the product and iſſues of things that do appear; the burning down of the Houſe, in the firſt Spark that kindles in the Thatch; in the entrance of the Thief in at the Door, he ſees all the rifling and bloodſhed that afterwards follows.</p>
            <p>Sinner, how is it that thou art ſo ſecure? Friend, what ſeeſt thou? Some it may be will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer as the Prophet's Servant when he firſt went up to <hi>Carmel,</hi> 1 Kin. 18.43. <hi>I ſee nothing.</hi> Others will anſwer, as he did at his laſt going up, <hi>I ſee a Cloud,</hi> but it's but a little one no bigger than a Man's hand. But the Prophet ſaw a great Rain in that little Cloud. Sinner, thou that yet ſeeſt nothing, nothing to trouble thee, nothing to make thee afraid, look again and again, even unto ſeven times: Doſt thou yet ſee a Cloud riſing? do not ſay it is a little one; take heed, if thy fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight do not, thy ſenſe will quickly tell thee what a Storm there is in it.</p>
            <p>Chriſtian, how is it that [thou] art ſo ſecure? where be thine eyes? art thou blind alſo? Doſt thou not ſee the Spark in the Thatch? Doſt thou not ſee the Thief at the Door? Haſt thou a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure within? haſt thou a God, a Conſcience, a Soul? haſt thou Grace, haſt thou Peace, haſt thou Hope? And doſt thou not ſee the Thief breaking in, and the Fire breaking out, that Luſt that is in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103224:13"/>
thine Heart, and the Temptations that are at the Door, ready to ſteal away or burn up every good thing thou haſt? How is it that there is no Cry heard within thee, <hi>Fire, Fire; Thieves, Thieves?</hi> Look to thy ſelf, ſave thy ſelf, O my Soul, from the miſchiefs and miſeries that are coming upon thee.</p>
            <p>We may give a Judgment of what Sin is bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth, by obſerving what it hath brought forth: Fear will conclude, that what hath been may be; It's like to be my caſe which hath been the caſe of others. What hath Sin done upon the World? How hath it filled them <hi>with all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, Fornication, Covetouſneſs, Wickedneſs, Maliciouſneſs, Envy, Murder, Debate, Deceit, Malignity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.29. What Fools, and Bruits, and Stocks hath it made them, fit for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to be Fuel for the Eternal Fire.</p>
            <p>And what hath it done even upon <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> or the Profeſſors of Chriſtianity? How low hath it held many of them? ſo low, that they can hardly tell whether they are alive or dead; and thoſe that have ſeem'd to be gotten up a little higher, how often hath it pull'd them down again, even to Death's Door. Some Profeſſors it hath ſlain out-right. The Chriſtianity they ſeem'd to have is dead and buried. O Friends, when you ſee what Sin and the Temptations thereof have done to others, is it not to be feared what it may do to you? May I not ſay to you, as <hi>Peter</hi> did to <hi>Saphira,</hi> (if you look not the more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to it) Acts 5.19. <hi>The Feet of thoſe that have buried thy Husband, are at the Door to carry thee out.</hi> The ſame Sins, the ſame Temptations that have ſlain your Friends and buried them, behold
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103224:13"/>
their feet are at the Door waiting for your Souls alſo. Open your eyes a little, and look who there are round about you; Behold the Pleaſures of Sin waiting for you, behold the Gains of Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs waiting, behold your Carnal Friends and Sinful Companions, behold the Perſecutions, and Scoffs, and Scorns, the Bonds, and Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are waiting at the Door; and what wait they for, but to carry out your Souls alſo dead, to thoſe that you have ſeen ſlain before you? Haſt thou ſeen what hath become of others, and doſt not therein foreſee what may become of thee, and canſt thou yet be ſecure?</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, you are Men of like Paſſions, and ſubject to the ſame Temptations with other Men; there's the ſame Pride, the ſame Luſt after the World, the ſame love of Carnal Pleaſures, the ſame fears of Fleſhly Sufferings rooted in your Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: And do you not feel theſe Evil Roots ſometimes budding, theſe Fires kindling? And have you not often ſuffered loſs by them? Yet you hope you have a little Faith, ſome Love to Chriſt, ſome Hope towards God, ſome Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Sin, ſome Affection for Things Above; let Luſt alone a-while, venture on upon Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions a-while; and O what leanneſs of Soul, yea, what Sickneſs, yea what Death may it bring upon you! What Carcaſſes may theſe living Souls quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly become? Lift up your eyes and look before you, foreſee the Evil before you be ſurprized and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up by it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>It hath forecaſt in it.</hi> Fear will make to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, 'twill put us to our ſhifts, 'twill ſet us a conſidering, and contriving, and caſting about, how we may beſt eſcape the danger we are in.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103224:14"/>
Fear hath <hi>care</hi> going along with it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. The Fearleſs ones, are the careleſs and the heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ones. A fearing Chriſtian will be a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect Chriſtian; he looks to his Steps, and takes heed to his Wayes that he ſin not, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.1. He will keep his Enemy in his Eye, that he fall not upon him at unawares. He is tender of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing, and therefore keeps his Watch, and ſtands upon his Guard continually. He ſees he walks among Temptations and Snares, and therefore looks diligently to his Foot that it be not taken in the Snare. He ſees how looſe and heedleſs Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians do ſmart for their folly; he ſees that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention is better than Repentance; and therefore though he will repent when he is fallen, yet he would rather make as little Work as may be for Repentance; Rejoycing that he hath been kept from Iniquity, he prizes at a higher rate than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting of Iniquity.</p>
            <p>A Prudent Man is a Provident Man. I ſee, ſaith the Fearing Soul, I ſee I am in danger; my Soul is in danger, my Life is in danger, I ſtand in Jeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardy every hour. Evil is before me, and it may come upon me ere I am aware. And what if it ſhould come upon me? Put the caſe I ſhould be overtaken, overtaken of Sin, overtaken of Wrath, how bitter will then my Folly be unto me? Nay, there's no [may be] in the Matter; Evil will come upon me, and I ſhall not eſcape, if I look not the better to it. But is there no way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it? Is there no ſecurity from the Snare, no refuge from the Storm, no ſhadow from the Heat? Muſt I fall? muſt I ſin, and be miſerable, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and is there no remedy? How may I eſcape? What's to be done to ſave my ſelf from evil?
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103224:14"/>
Theſe are the fore-caſtings of the Fearing Soul. And when they have found him out his Way, they hold him to it; when they have diſcovered a Refuge, they haſten him in. The Man-ſlayer needed no other Monitor, the Avenger of Blood at his Back, and the Fear in his Heart, put him to his Heels to haſten to the City of Refuge.</p>
            <p>Heb. 11.7. <hi>By Faith</hi> Noah <hi>being warned of God of things not ſeen as yet,</hi> (of a Deluge or Flood of Waters) <hi>moved with Fear, prepared an Ark to the ſaving of his Houſe.</hi> Mark it, his Faith moved his Fear, and his Fear put him on providing an Ark againſt the Waters. A Flood cometh to waſh away wickedneſs from the Earth, and to drown all the Sinners thereof. This Faith foreſaw an hundred and twenty years before it came; and thereupon Fear cries out, O for an Ark to ſave from the Waters! It's no time to lie ſtill and ſleep, it's no time to ſit eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to be marrying and giving in marriage; an Ark, an Ark muſt be prepared to ſave from the Flood.</p>
            <p>Let me here by the way put in a word or two to this Age and Nation.</p>
            <p>Hath God ſaid nothing? Doth Faith ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a Flood coming upon us? Is there ſuch a <hi>Deluge of Sin</hi> amongſt us; and doth not that propheſie to us of <hi>a Deluge of Wrath?</hi> Lift up your Eyes Chriſtians, ſtand and look through the Land, Eaſtward and Weſtward, Northward and South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and tell me what you ſee. Behold a Flood cometh, a Flood of Sin is already broken forth upon us, the Fountains of the great Deeps are broken up, and the Windows of Hell are opened, and is there not a mighty Stream of Iniquity run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103224:15"/>
down, even from all Parties among us? From one Party, the <hi>openly profane,</hi> Behold a Flood of <hi>Atheiſm and Infidelity;</hi> amongſt thoſe that ſtill bear the Name of Chriſt upon their Foreheads, what multitudes are there that are <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi> in Heart and Life? A Flood of <hi>Oaths, and Curſes, and Blaſphemies;</hi> Are there not many Men become like that Beaſt that aroſe out of the Sea, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.1. having <hi>the Name of Blaſphemy</hi> upon their Heads? A Flood of <hi>filthy Luſts and ſtupendious Adulteries;</hi> What a new <hi>Sodom</hi> is there ſprung up out of the Aſhes of the old, and hath not the Younger out-done the Deeds of the Elder? A Flood of <hi>Fury and Rage</hi> is broken forth, ſuch a Flood as the Serpent caſt out of his Mouth after the Woman, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.15. Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions raiſed upon thoſe that ſeparate themſelves from the filthineſs of the Land.</p>
            <p>And beſides theſe Streams that come by the way of the Wilderneſs, behold another Stream that riſes even in the Garden of the Lord; the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Sanctuary are become a muddy Stream and a troubled Sea, that caſts up Mire and Dirt. A mixed Stream comes forth, Diviſions, Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Quarrellings, Hereſies, Hypocriſies, Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, Unmercifulneſs, with but a very little Truth and Righteouſneſs among. The Waters of Grace and Peace, the ſtill Waters are but low Waters, and run ſo ſoftly, as if the Fountain were quite dryed up; and inſtead thereof, Pride, Haughtineſs, Headineſs and Uncharitableneſs, how do they ſwell amongſt us, and riſe higher eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day?</p>
            <p>In this <hi>Flood of Sin,</hi> how eaſie is it for him that hath eyes, to ſee a <hi>Flood of Wrath</hi> even running
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103224:15"/>
in upon us to conſume us from off the Earth: But all this while, where be the <hi>Noahs</hi> amongſt us? What preparations is there making for an Ark againſt the Flood? How is it that we are ſo ſecure? There be many amongſt us that are cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, A Flood, a Flood cometh, can our Land any longer bear the Iniquities of it? Can the Soul of God but be avenged of ſuch a People as this? But how few of us are there heard crying, An Ark, an Ark, to ſave us from the Flood? And of thoſe that cry an Ark, how very few are there that are preparing an Ark? How is it that we are not every one ſhifting for our ſelves, and hiding our ſelves from the Evil to come? I do not mean ſhifting, to hide our ſelves by our Wits, much leſs by our wickedneſs; wo to ſuch ſhifters who make ſhipwrack of Faith and a good Conſcience, to ſave themſelves from drowning, who choak themſelves in the Mud, to ſave themſelves from the Waters. But how is it that there is no more care taken to hide our ſelves in God, to imbarque with Chriſt, and to lodg our ſelves in the Ark of the Covenant of God? What hiding place have we but Chriſt? What Ark can we have, that will bear us up above the Waters, but the Ark of the Covenant? there we may be ſafe; in Chriſt, and out of danger; in Covenant with God, and out of fear of the Wrath of God.</p>
            <p>How is it that there is no more enquiring, Am I in Chriſt? am I in Covenant? have I broken my Covenant with Death, and diſannulled my Agreement with Hell? Am I no longer in League with my Sins and this evil World, have I broken with them all, and am I gotten within the Bond of the Covenant of God? If I think I have, yet
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103224:16"/>
am I not miſtaken? Many Souls have been miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, have thought themſelves within, who have yet dyed without; and am not I miſtaken alſo? Is the thing ſure? Is Chriſt mine indeed?</p>
            <p>How is it that there is no more asking the way to the City of Refuge? <hi>How may I get into Chriſt? Or how may I know whether I be in Chriſt or not?</hi> O how is it that we do not awaken our ſlumbring Spirits, and call upon our careleſs Hearts! <hi>Come on, O my lingring Soul, make haſte, get thee up to the Rock; to Sanctuary, to Sanctuary; Awake thou Sleeper, careſt thou not that thou periſh? Come my Soul, enter thou into thy Chamber; hide thy ſelf till the Indignation be over-paſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How is it that there is no more ſuch care taken? Are we ſo ſolicitous as we ſhould be about this matter? How is it with [you] Friends? Are you buſie in conſidering, and fore-caſting, and enquiring how you may eſcape? What is it that your fear of a Deluge hath put you upon, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide your ſelves againſt it? Is there any more cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection and heedfulneſs in your goings? any more tenderneſs of Sin? Are you throwing off thoſe weights that will ſink you with the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude? Are you buſie in breaking down your Sins, and building up your ſelves, in hope of the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God? Behold how generally our other Matters do ſtill take up our Time and Thoughts; we are building of Houſes, and planting of Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, and Buying and Selling, and Marrying and giving in Marriage, ſeldom giving our ſelves leave to think of a Flood that's coming to take us all away. O fear, and let your fear ſet you on work to ſave your ſelves from Miſery and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:103224:16"/>The fooliſh World laugh at this Fear; What jealous-headed melancholick Souls are theſe? What Dreams and Fancies do they fright them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves withal? And ſo did the old World doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs laugh at <hi>Noah,</hi> to ſee him ſuch a Fanatick to amuſe himſelf and others with ſuch a ſtrange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of a Flood, and to go build an Ark to ſave himſelf from that Dream of a Deluge. What laughing and mocking think you was there then amongſt them, to hear this Preacher of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Preach, and prepare for ſuch a ſtrange in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible thing? Such mockings are there of the Men of this World, at the fears and preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Saints, againſt the Judgments of God. I, but when the Ark was finiſhed, and <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family gotten in, and the Flood came in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt; when they ſaw the Rain pouring down, the Waters ſwelling, the Seas roaring, and tumbling in, in whole Mountains of Waters upon them; where was the laugh of the World then? What a cry was their laugh then turned to? Let Sinners laugh at laſt when they ſhall ſee all theſe things come upon them, when the overflowing Scourge cometh, and they ſhall then ſee the derided Saints gotten into the Ark, and themſelves left out to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in the Waters.</p>
            <p>Well, by this time you may ſee what this Fear is, or who is this Man that feareth. The Man of Underſtanding, that ſo knows God, his Goodneſs and Severity; that ſo knows Sin, its Malignity, and the Miſery that it expoſes to; that ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves God, that hath ſuch a love for God and his own Soul, and ſuch an averſation from Sin; that ſo foreſees the danger he is in, of running into Sin, and falling into Miſery, that he wiſely and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103224:17"/>
warily looks to himſelf, keeps himſelf from Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and hides himſelf from thoſe Miſchiefs and Miſeries, which the reſt of the World fooliſhly venture upon, and are deſtroyed by in the end. This is the Man that feareth, this is the happy Man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>What is that bleſſedneſs that is pronounced to him that feareth? Happy is the Man that feareth.</hi> To Happineſs two things are required.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Sufficiency.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>Security.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Sufficiency.</hi> He that is in want is in miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; what-ever he hath, how greatly ſoever he abounds; yet if he hath not all that he needs, yea, all that he deſires; <hi>In the fulneſs of his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency he is in ſtraits,</hi> The pain of what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and hath not, imbitters the pleaſures of what he hath. No Sufficiency, no Satisfaction, ſhort of Satisfaction, ſo far ſhort of Happineſs. He muſt have all things that would find reſt in any thing; He that poſſeſſes what-ever he can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, that's an happy Man, only to this muſt be added,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Security.</hi> What we have to day, may be loſt to morrow. He that hath moſt, and holds it by ſuch an uncertain Tenure, is ſo far from find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſt in what he hath, that he may be in greater perplexity than he that hath nothing. Therefore can there be no happineſs in any thing under the Sun; for beſides the inſufficiency of theſe world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, (the whole Earth is too little to fill the Soul, all this great World is not enough to fill the little World, <hi>Man</hi>) but beſides this, were they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103224:17"/>
ſufficient, what ſecurity can be had for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of them to us? They are all but caſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they come and go, they have all their Wings, and who knows how ſoon they may take their flight? At the beſt, <hi>The things that are ſeen are but Temporal,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.18. There muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manence &amp; durableneſs in the matter of our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. The durable Riches, the enduring Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, an Inheritance that fadeth not away, and there muſt be ſecurity againſt their being loſt or taken away.</p>
            <p>Now this is the happineſs of him that feareth, he hath ſufficient, and what he hath is in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He hath a ſufficiency.</hi> This Fear, as appears from what hath been ſpoken, is a Religious Fear; the Fear of God is ſometimes taken for all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; here only for one particular Branch of it, yet ſuch as argues the Truth of Religion, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles the Soul to the whole income and revenue of Religion. He that knows, believes, and loves God, and therefore fears and flies from Sin and Wrath, is certainly a Godly Man, and ſhall have his Inheritance with the Juſt.</p>
            <p>The firſt Sermon that ever we read, that Chriſt Preached, begins with an enumeration of the Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of this very Man. <hi>He ſhall inherit the Earth, he ſhall be comforted, he ſhall be filled, he ſhall obtain Mercy, he ſhall ſee God, his is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven.</hi> All theſe Graces that are there mentioned, Poverty of Spirit, Purity in Heart, hunger after Righteouſneſs, Meekneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the particular Qualifications of this very Man. And we may write down after that Copy, Bleſſed is the Man that feareth, for his is the Kingdom of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:103224:18"/>
God; Bleſſed is the Man that feareth, for he ſhall be comforted, he ſhall obtain Mercy, he ſhall ſee God. This is the Man who <hi>ſhall inherit all things,</hi> Rev. 21.7. and <hi>ſhall want nothing,</hi> Pſal. 34.10. He is provided for, for Soul and for Body, for this Life and that to come. The Promiſe is his Portion, and in the Promiſe there is all things. There's Bread in the Promiſe, and Cloaths, and Houſes, and Lands, and Friends; there's Grace and Glory in the Promiſe. And to have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance in the Promiſe, is to him as good as to have it in hand, and in ſome reſpects better. Thou art a Fool, Soul, who ſayeſt with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal, <hi>Give me my Portion;</hi> 'tis better where 'tis, God will look better to thee, than thou to thy ſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>He hath Security.</hi> All that he hath is in ſafety. He that hath moſt, and is in danger of loſing all, as (I ſaid before) is in greater perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than he that hath nothing to loſe. The Poor Man ſleeps in more quiet than he that hath his Houſe full of Treaſure, if he be in danger of the Robber. Enough is not enough, 'twill never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent whilſt there is hazard of loſing all. The Man that feareth hath enough, and all he hath is in ſafety; Prov. 1.33. <hi>Whoſo hearkneth to me, ſhall dwell ſafely, he ſhall be quiet from [fear] of evil.</hi> He that feareth ſhall be moſt free from fear, the Fear of God will fortifie him againſt the Fears of the World.</p>
            <p>Particularly conſider theſe two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Matters wherein his Happineſs lies are ſure.</hi> The Mercies of God are ſure Mercies, that will neither fade away, nor can be taken away. If there be uncertainty in what a Chriſtian hath of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103224:18"/>
this World, he is well enough notwithſtanding; theſe are not his Happineſs, he may be as happy in his greateſt penury, as in his greateſt plenty. This is eaſily ſaid, O that it were but ſoundly believed! What a calm and ſerene ſtate might Chriſtians then live in in the greateſt tempeſts.</p>
            <p>The Matters of a Chriſtians happineſs are ſure and certain Things. The portion of the World is not capable of being made ſure. As one ſayes well; <q>The World flies,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Gouge.</hi>

Come to a Family this year, and behold as <hi>Job 21.10. Their Bull gendereth and faileth not, their Cow calveth and caſteth not her Calf.</hi> Their Fig-Tree bloſſoms, their Vine flouriſheth; there are Flocks in the Fold, there are Herds in the Stall, and then they are all merry and at reſt: They ſend forth their little Ones as a Flock, and their Children dance; they are cloathed with Purple and Scarlet, and fare ſumptuouſly every day; they take the Timbrel and the Harp, and rejoyce at the ſound of the Organ. Come to the very ſame Family a few years after, and all's gone, and then their Purple is turned into Sack-cloth, their Muſick into Mourning, and their Mirth into Heavineſs.</q>

               <q>The World runs upon Wheels. The Wheel of Providence is ever turning; now one's at the top of the Wheel, and then another comes up, and he that was juſt now at the top, by and by tumbles and the Wheel runs over him. How often do Rich Men break, and Poor Men get up for a while in their
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103224:19"/>
rooms, and then tumble down after them? To day then haſt an Eſtate, and dwelleſt at eaſe in thine own cieled Houſe; but who can tell where he may find thou to morrow? To day thou liveſt, and art in health, and nothing ails thee; to morrow thou mayeſt die, the Grave may cover thee, and Worms may be feeding upon thee. Such an uncertain World this is, and at ſuch uncertainties are the things thereof, and there's no preventing of it. It cannot be otherwiſe, the wiſeſt, the warieſt, the moſt provident and induſtrious Man in the World, do what he can, can never be at a certainty for two dayes together. The Thief, the Moth, the Fire, Sickneſs and Death, may quickly divide betwixt him and his portion, and take away either him from it, or it from him. But the Treaſure of the Man that fears God, is a Treaſure that faileth not, an enduring Subſtance.</q>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>His very Fear is a means to keep what he hath in ſafety.</hi> Jer. 32.40. <hi>I will put my Fear in their hearts that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> Though when God hath hold of us, he will never loſe his hold; yet he holds us by certain Cords, which ſhould they break or give off, we ſhould certainly be gone and be loſt. One of theſe Cords is <hi>Faith,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.5. <hi>We are kept by the mighty Power of God, through Faith, unto Salvation.</hi> Another of theſe Cords is this of <hi>Fear. I will put my Fear into their hearts that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> Whereupon we may ſay alſo, <hi>We are kept by the mighty Power of God [through Fear] unto Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> God makes uſe of our Fear of loſing all, to prevent our loſs. As if we ſhould ceaſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, ſo if we ſhould ceaſe to Fear, we ſhould be undone at laſt. Upon a little looſening of this
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:103224:19"/>
Cord, how often do we ſuffer great loſs? When we take head, and grow bold and venturous; when we do forget our danger, and ſo lay by our Armour, how much miſchief do we run our ſelves into? Haſt thou never loſt thy Peace, and all ſenſe of the love of God? Haſt thou never loſt thy Affections, and all thy delight in God? Haſt thou never fallen by thy folly into Sin, into a vain and carnal frame, into a dead and barren ſtate, and thereby provoked the Lord to withdraw and hide his Face from thee, and been caſt back in the ſtate of thy Soul? Doſt thou not often ſee this to be thy caſe? thou winkeſt if thou doſt not; why, thou ſhouldſt not have been ſo venturous, thou ſhould'ſt have feared in time, and all this miſchief might have been prevented. Whilſt Fear ſtands Centinel, the Enemy hath the leſs hope of making an Invaſion upon thee. But where this Fear is not, that Soul dwells like the wealthy Nation, Jer. 49.31. <hi>without care, and having neither Gates</hi> nor Bars, and ſo becomes a booty and a ſpoil to the Enemy. Where Care is the Gate, and Fear hath bolted the Gate, there all is in ſafety.</p>
            <p>This Fear may expoſe and make more obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to temporal Evils; How much do Chriſtians often loſe by their Fear? They loſe their Friends, and loſe their Eſtates and their Liberties, and ſometimes their Lives, upon this very account, that they are afraid to ſin againſt God. And yet all this while they are in ſafety, and when they have caſt up their Accounts, they find they are no loſers, though they have loſt all that ever they had; their Souls are in ſafety, and that's enough to ſave them harmleſs under all their Sufferings. He whoſe Face is filled with the contempt of the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103224:20"/>
Proud, whoſe back is bowed down that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly may go over it, whoſe Name is made a ſcorn and deriſion, whoſe Goods become a booty and a ſpoil, and his very Life becomes a Sacrifice to the rage of the cruel, if he does but come off with the ſafety of his Soul, that's enough to make him abundant recompence for all. As Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.26. <hi>What ſhall it profit a Man to win the whole World and loſe his own Soul?</hi> So may it not be ſaid, What ſhall it prejudice a Man to loſe all the World if he ſave his own Soul? Thou knoweſt not what a Soul is, what the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of a Soul is, thou knoweſt not what Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, what that Life and Death means, who canſt not ſay, Let me eſcape that Death, let me obtain that Life, and it is enough. O ſtudy the World to come more, ſecure to thy ſelf the eternal Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and then thou wilt ſay with the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> what-ever thy condition be here, <hi>I will lay me down in peace and take my reſt, for thou, Lord, makeſt me dwell in ſafety.</hi> But more of this here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>By what hath been ſaid, it appeareth, that the Man that feareth, is an happy Man, and wherein his happineſs lies.</p>
            <p>It's true, that in this World he is but inchoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively and incompleatly happy; but an happy Man he is: As he that's Heir to a great Eſtate, even whilſt he is under Age, and hath little in poſſeſſion, may be ſaid to be a Rich Man, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if he be under the care of a faithful Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; no leſs may a Chriſtian, even in his non-age, be ſaid to be an happy Man. There's no happy Man in the World, if this be not he; When he is at loweſt, it's better with him than with the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:103224:20"/>
beſt of Sinners. Some Sinners will grant their Conſcience tells them ſo, that he that fears God, will have the beſt of it in the other World; but yet they conclude, that themſelves have the better of it here. But they are miſtaken, even in this Life, a Godly Man hath the better of Sinners. He knows little of God, he hath little underſtood the Joy of Faith, the Pleaſure of Love, the Eaſe of Sincerity, the Peace of Conſcience, the Gain of Godlineſs, that would exchange lives with the beſt of Sinners here in this World. The very hopes of the Saints fill them with more joy than the greateſt poſſeſſions of the ungodly. I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther take my lot with <hi>Job</hi> on the Dunghil, than with <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> on his Throne; with <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> in his Sores and Beggary, than with <hi>Dives</hi> in his Purple and delicate Fare; with <hi>Paul</hi> in his Bonds, than with <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Bernice</hi> in their Pomp; with that Priſoner at the Bar, than his Judges at the Bench. He that is otherwiſe mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is guilty of one of theſe abſurdities, either to think that God is not better than Creatures, or that the ungodly enjoy as much of God, as thoſe that are Godly. If God be better than the World, if God be the preſent Portion of the Godly, and of them alone, then he that feareth God is the happieſt Man even in this Life.</p>
            <p>But O what will his bleſſedneſs hereafter be! What advantage will he have of Sinners in the other World? When the compariſon ſhall no longer be betwixt God and the Creatures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the fulneſs of Heaven, and the fatneſs of the Earth; when the Queſtion ſhall no longer be, which is beſt, peace of Conſcience, or the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of the World, the hopes of Glory, or the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103224:21"/>
pleaſures of Sin; the worſt of Saints, or the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners beſt: But the queſtion will then be, Which is the beſt, the Pleaſures of the Saints, or the Plagues of Sinners; the Fruition of God, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation from God; the Joyes Above, or the Pangs Beneath? Then let it be conſidered, then ſhall it be diſcerned who are the happy Perſons, thoſe that Fear God, or thoſe that fear him not.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Raſhneſs,</hi> Haſtineſs or Headineſs in our way. Fear will make Men conſider. 'Twas good Counſel which the Town-Clerk gave in the Tumult, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.36. that they did nothing raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; Eccleſ. 5.2. <hi>Be not raſh with thy Mouth, neither
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103224:21"/>
let thy heart be haſty to utter any thing before God.</hi> The Apoſtle reckons haſty ones among the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Perſons, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.4. Men ſhall be heady, <hi>precipites,</hi> running headlong on their courſe, act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not upon Counſel, but their ſuddain appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, or any ſtrong impulſes of their hearts; at all adventures, whether it be right or wrong. Fear will make Men wary, and adviſed what they do.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians, if you would walk ſafely, look be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, ſpeak nothing raſhly, do nothing raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, weigh your Thoughts and Intentions before you let them paſs into action. How many Evils doth raſhneſs and headineſs run us upon? Thoſe words which in an heat we have let fly, ſome of our haſty Carriages and Actions have ſometimes coſt us many dayes ſorrow and repentance, which had we been cautelous, and a little better adviſed, might have been prevented. Sometimes a ſudden paſſion ariſes, and out it goes in angry and frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard words, ſetting all in an uproar and combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; by and by our hearts recur upon us, and then we wiſh, O that I had bit my Tongue, and not given it ſuch an unbridled liberty. Sometimes we break out into raſh cenſures of thoſe that it may be are better than our ſelves; whereupon when we reflect, we are aſhamed that the Fool's Bolt was ſo ſoon ſhot, and wiſh we had been judging our ſelves when we were cenſuring our Brethren. Take heed you miſtake not raſhneſs and headineſs, for <hi>Zeal;</hi> I would not cool Godly Zeal, there's too little of it in the World. We need the Spur more than the Bridle; the Bellows, nor the Bucket. We may not quench true Zeal, the Lord be merciful to us, there is not ſo much of it to be
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103224:22"/>
found; we had more need caſt on Oil than Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon that Holy Fire; Zeal for Truth, Zeal for Righteouſneſs and Holineſs; how happy were it if there were more ſuch Flames, if all our ſhining were alſo burning Lights? But Zeal muſt be <hi>regular;</hi> as for the Matter of it, it muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes <hi>in a good thing,</hi> Gal. 4.18. So it muſt be managed with good Counſel and Caution; miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken Zeal is a Fire that devours that good that it pretends to promote.</p>
               <p>But as you may not run headlong upon that which hath the face of Good, much leſs upon that which is apparently evil. It's dangerous to be heady in the Matters of God, wherein, in caſe we are right, we can never over-do; but much more miſchievous to run headlong upon Sin; Jer. 8.6. <hi>Every one turned to his courſe, as the Horſe ruſheth into the Battel,</hi> without fear or wit. O the witleſs mad-headed multitude of Sinners in the World, how do they ruſh on upon their wickedneſs? they will neither ask Counſel nor take Counſel, but on they will at a venture, come of it what will.</p>
               <p>Stand Sinner and fear, fear and conſider; what is it thou art doing? whither is it thou art run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning? thou wilt on thy Way, thou wilt after thy Luſts, and after thy Companions; thou wilt after theſe Riches, and theſe Pleaſures, there's no ſtopping thee, nor putting thee to pauſe upon it; thou art all in haſte, and impatient to be adviſed: But yet for all thy haſte, take heed of what comes after, thy Bargain is not like to be ſo good as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſuch haſte; haſty Bargains ſeldom want woe. What-ever is done raſhly, ſeldom comes to any other iſſue, but either Repentance or Ruine.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:103224:22"/>
                  <hi>Qui ante non cavet,</hi> &amp;c. If thou wilt not Fear, thou wilt ſhortly find what 'tis to be thus head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong and precipitant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Audacity,</hi> or fool-hardineſs, or mad ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſneſs upon known dangers. This is of kin to raſhneſs, but is not the ſame. It is the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream to <hi>Cowardiſe;</hi> the mean betwixt both is <hi>Fortitude.</hi> The Fear we are now treating of, is not oppoſite to Fortitude as Cowardiſe is; 'tis not from puſillanimity, but from magnanimity that we thus fear. The moſt Heroick Spirits moſt fear to be baſe; <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.17. Thoſe worthy Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives feared God, and feared to ſin againſt God, and therefore <hi>feared not the Wrath of the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as this Holy Fear doth not argue faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartedneſs, ſo neither doth that audacity argue fortitude. Is it valour or madneſs for a naked Man to run upon an Army of Enemies? Such De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperadoes as kick againſt the pricks, and run up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Pikes of Divine Vengeance, who knowing the Judgment of God againſt them that do ſuch things, will yet run their courſe of In quity, not fearing of Judgments, laughing at Reproofs, Threatnings and Warnings, and deriding thoſe trembling Hearts that dare not run on with them to the ſame exceſs of riot. What gallantry of Spirit do they count themſelves to have arrived unto? Gallantry of Spirit! what to dare the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty to his Face? to challenge Death and Hell to meet you in the Field? for the Briars and Thorns to gather themſelves to Battel againſt the devouring Fire? Sure if ever you come to your wits, you will underſtand how mad you have been.</p>
               <p>Sinner, dareſt thou continue in thine unbelief
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103224:23"/>
and impenitency, when thou knoweſt that he that believeth not, ſhall be damned; he that repenteth not, ſhall periſh for ever? Dareſt thou to walk af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thy Luſts, fulfilling the deſires of the Fleſh and of the Mind, when thou knoweſt that they that live after the fleſh, ſhall die? Thou knoweſt what the place and the portion of the Proud, of the Covetous, of the Liars, of the Hypocrites is, and yet dareſt thou continue in the number and the way of theſe Men?</p>
               <p>Doſt thou dare to go down quick into the Pit, to take up thy dwelling in everlaſting Darkneſs, and thy lodging in the Eternal Fire? Awaken from this Folly, put away this madneſs from thee; Awake and tremble to think what a deſperate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture thou haſt hitherto run.</p>
               <p>If you ſhould ſee your Children in ſport jump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over a boyling Furnace, dancing on the Battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a Tower, or in a frolick, ſtanding on tip-toe on the Weather-cock of a Steeple, how would your Bowels turn, your Bones tremble, and all within you ſhake and ſhiver? And will you yet be more venturous and fool-hardy your ſelves? If ever you come to your ſelves, you will be your own Wonder and Fear.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Security,</hi> Carnal Security. Security is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten taken for Safety. To have our Eſtates, or our Peace, or our Souls ſecured, is the ſame as to have them all in ſafety. Job 11.14, 15. <hi>If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, then ſhalt thou be ſecure, becauſe there is hope, and thou ſhalt take thy reſt in ſafety.</hi> This <hi>Carnal Security</hi> is a retch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs or careleſneſs of Heart; to be without ſenſe of our danger, and without ſollicitude for our ſafety. The cares of this Life, and the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:103224:23"/>
of the Fleſh, do ſtupifie the Sinners of the Earth; do lay their Souls a-ſleep, and bind up their ſenſes, ſo that they neither fear nor mind what's like to come upon them. This was the caſe of the old World, in the dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> Luke 17.27. <hi>They did eat, they drank, they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and were given in marriage, till the day came that</hi> Noah <hi>entred into the Ark.</hi> Their ſenſuality laid them all a-ſleep, and they never dream't of that Flood that came and deſtroyed them all. It is ſaid of the Men of <hi>Laiſh,</hi> Judges 18.7. <hi>They dwelt careleſs, after the manner of the</hi> Zidonians, <hi>they were quiet and ſecure.</hi> They neither feared Enemies, nor made any proviſion againſt them, but left themſelves open to the mercy of any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vader. Secure Sinners lay themſelves open to all manner of miſchiefs; the Tempter may come, the Avenger may come upon them before they are aware; and he that may come will come; <hi>The Lord of that Servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in ſunder, and appoint him his portion with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers,</hi> Luke 12.46.</p>
               <p>O how ſick is this World of this Lethargick Diſtemper! We cannot ſay, as once 'twas ſaid, Iſa. 33.14. <hi>The Sinners in</hi> Zion <hi>are afraid, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs hath ſurprized the Hypocrites.</hi> Behold the Sinners all aſleep, and who is there among the Hypocrites that fears? But how is it with you Sinners, are you in no danger? Is there no Devil in the World? or is there no fear that he intends to hurt you? Is that Lion that us'd to walk up and down ſeeking whom to devour, is he now confin'd to his Den, ſo that he cannot hurt the Earth any more? Are your Luſts, thoſe Lion's
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103224:24"/>
Whelps, grown tame? Do they no longer war in your Members? Doth the World ceaſe to be a temptation and a ſnare, and are you out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of that Perdition and Deſtruction, in which it draws its Lovers? Is there no danger of your becoming Proud, or Covetous, or Senſualiſts, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Riches, lovers of Pleaſures more than lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of God; or is it no harm if you be ſo? Nay what woful Work hath been made upon you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready? What inrodes and invaſions have been made, and are not your Souls already taken Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives? Behold that ignorance and folly, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence and weakneſs, that enmity and perverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that malice and envy wherewith your hearts are already filled, and that ſtupidity and ſenſleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs under all theſe evils that appear upon you; What doth all this portend? Doth it ſpeak good concerning you? Doth it ſay thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning you, theſe Men are in an happy ſtate, there's no fear to Men in ſuch a caſe? no fear of the Covetous, no fear of the Drunkards, and the Lyars, and the Scoffers, they are all happy Men. Conſider Man, whither doth Luſt lead but to Sin, and whither doth Sin lead but to Death and to Hell? Be not miſtaken, that's the Lake, that this whole Herd of Swine, being driven by the Devil, are running headlong into. Friends, this is the very caſe that the World is brought into, it lyeth in Wickedneſs, and runneth upon Vengeance. And yet, behold, all at quiet, all ſecure; no news, nor noiſe, nor fear of danger, but all in peace. Doſt thou not find, Sinner, that none of theſe things move thee, or put thee to any trouble or care. And is this ſleepy Evil, the Diſeaſe only of the World? Are there none to be found, <hi>in the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:103224:24"/>
Churches of God,</hi> ſick of the ſame Diſeaſe? Is there that watchfulneſs, that jealouſie that ſhould be upon thoſe that profeſs themſelves Chriſtians, and to have eſcaped the pollutions of the World, through the knowledg of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt? Do theſe Virgins alwayes ſtand with their Loins girded, and their Lights burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Do not [our] Souls alſo lie open to the temptation? is not our foot often taken in the ſnare? What means the dimneſs of our Light, the damp that is upon our Love, the ſpots upon our Faces, the clouds that we ſometimes find up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all our Comforts? What means our poverty and leanneſs, our frequent decayes and backſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding? How hath this World crowded in with ſo much of its Cares and Luſts, and hath ſeated it ſelf ſo near the Throne of God? Are there no worldly Profeſſors, no covetous, greedy Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors? Is it a ſign thou haſt ſtood upon thy Guard, that there are ſo many Thorns ſprung up, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Thieves ſtollen in before thou wert aware? Doſt thou not ſee how thou art ſurprized daily, and met with at every turn? Doſt thou not often confeſs this to the Lord, and complain againſt thy ſelf, what an uneven, unſtable Soul thou art, and how many, and how great thy Falls and Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are? and haſt thou not ſtill abundant matter of the ſame Complaints to make? Who would think 'twere poſſible, that ſuch a <hi>ſoul</hi> ſhould yet be ſecure and careleſs? Haſt thou catch'd ſo many a Fall for want of fear of falling, how then canſt thou but Fear? And yet after all this, after this ſinning and falling, and confeſſing, and complaining, how quickly is all forgotten, and about the World a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain we go to our Buſineſſes, to our Recreations,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:103224:25"/>
to this Company, to that, any whither, whither our Hearts or Occaſions lead us, leaving our ſelves as open to every Temptation that meets us, as if we had never ſuffered by it?</p>
               <p>This Evil, as 'tis a common, ſo it is a dreadful Evil; there's a Woe denounced againſt it, <hi>Amos</hi> 6.1. <hi>Wo to them that are at eaſe in</hi> Zion. [To them that are at eaſe] that is, to th m that are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, as you have it in the Margin [In <hi>Zion</hi>] in the Church of God.

               <p>'Tis a wretched thing to behold a ſecure <hi>World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> ſecure Aliens and Strangers from God, who know not the Judgments of God; but to ſee a company of ſecure <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> of ſecure Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, to whom it hath been ſaid, Awaken thou that ſleepeſt, ſtand up from the Dead, ſave thy ſelf from that miſery that is coming upon the World; this is indeed a woful and a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful thing.

maintaining of this whole Diſeaſe; I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large a little upon it.</p>
               <p>By the Evil Day, underſtand <hi>the day of retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution or recompence;</hi> whether it be the day of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation in this World, or the day of Death and of Judgment.</p>
               <p>There is a double putting this evil day afar off. There is a putting it,

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Far from our Reins;</hi> That is, from our Thoughts and Conſideration; as <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Thou art near in their Mouth, and far from their Reins.</hi> Thou art much ſpoken of, but little thought on. Thus Men put the Evil Day far off, when they do not think of ſuch a day; it's out of ſight and out of mind with them; 'tis the leaſt of all their Thoughts, that there is an evil day coming. The thoughts of ſuch a day, would have the ſame effect, as that cry that was made at the coming of the Bridegroom, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.6. <hi>At midnight there was a Cry made, Behold, the Bridegroom cometh;</hi> and this cry turn'd Midnight into Morning; all the Sleepers awakned, and aroſe, and trimmed their Lamps.</p>
               <p>How is it Friends that there is not ſuch a Cry made every Day and every Night? How is it that your Hearts do not ſtill cry in your Ears, The Day of the Lord is near, the Judg is at the Door, the Avenger is at the Heels, Behold the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom cometh? O this ſeldom enters into our Hearts, this Day of the Lord is far from our Reins.</p>
               <p>If the Evil Day were kept nearer us, 'twould
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:103224:26"/>
make Evil Works keep farther off. If when Men are jolly, and merry, and mad after their Luſts, and drunken into a dead ſleep in their Sins; If whilſt others are idle and ſlothful, are retchleſs and ſupine in their Spirits and Ways, laying by all care and circumſpection over themſelves, giving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to the heedleſneſs of their ſluggiſh hearts; and hereby led out into thoſe ſins &amp; vanities which are the Fruits of ſuch Security, if ſuch Thoughts ſhould ariſe in their Minds, and ſit cloſe upon their Hearts; How ſhall I anſwer for this in the Day of the Lord? Is not the Day of the Lord coming? Is it not near? May not the very next day be the Evil Day? And if it ſhould prove to be ſo indeed, what a caſe am I in if my Judg ſhould find me thus? How would ſuch Thoughts ſcatter away Iniquity, and ſcare ſuch drowſie Souls out of all their eaſe and ſlothfulneſs?</p>
               <p>Friend conſider, thou knoweſt what a life 'tis thou ordinarily liveſt; Art not thou one of thoſe that art at eaſe in <hi>Zion?</hi> art not thou the Man that dwelleſt careleſs, that art quiet and ſecure? haſt not thou left thy Soul, like that City that hath neither Gates nor Bars? is not that heart of thine left open Night and Day? let the Tempter come when he will, he may find eaſie entrance? Is not thine heart open to Temptations, yea, and open to Wrath and Vengeance? Wouldſt thou be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the Day of the Lord ſhould find thee thus? Art thou ſure but that Day may find thee thus? Would not ſuch a Voice from Heaven, <hi>Thy Day is come,</hi> ſtrike thee into horror and amazement, and ſtrike through thy eaſie lazie Soul, as a Dart through thy Liver? O why wilt thou not try, what <hi>ſome thoughts</hi> of that Day might do, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:103224:26"/>
it would not perſwade thee to a wiſer courſe, and put thee into a better caſe, againſt it comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed?</p>
               <p>It is a ſtrange thing that it ſhould be poſſible for Sinners, (that believe the Scriptures) not to think of a day of recompence. Haſt thou not heard? doſt thou not read, that the Wages of Sin is Death? doſt thou not know that every working day muſt have its pay-day? Canſt thou be Sowing daily, and never think of Reaping? And haſt thou not learned, That as thy Sowing is, ſuch muſt thy Reaping be? that an evil Seed-time, will bring forth an evil Harveſt? Canſt thou be Sowing Tares, and either not think of Reaping at all, or think of Reaping Wheat? Is this all the wit thou haſt? <hi>Be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, as Men Sow ſo ſhall they alſo Reap; he that Soweth to the Fleſh, ſhall Reap Corruption; he that Soweth to the Spirit, ſhall Reap Life Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Gal. 6.7, 8. Know it in time, and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thy Sowing, think of thy Reaping-Day.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Men put the Evil Day far from their Loyns.</hi> That is, though they do think of the Judgments of God, and as ſuch, as both may overtake them, and if they fall, will fall heavy upon them, and grind them to Pouder; yet they count 'twill be a great while firſt, there may be time enough to prevent them, or at leaſt the diſtance they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend of them, from them, makes them the leſs to be feared or regarded; Eccleſ. 1.8. <hi>Becauſe Sentence againſt an evil work, is not executed ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, therefore the Heart of the Sons of Men is fully ſet in them to do evil.</hi> Becauſe Judgment is ſo long a-coming, therefore they grow bold in their Sin, as if 'twould never come. Not till after a long time, is almoſt the ſame with them, as never at
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103224:27"/>
all. As if becauſe the Bench and the Gibbet, ſtand not both together, becauſe the Sin and its Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, the Sentence and its Execution are not on the ſame day, therefore there will be no Sentence, no Execution; as if becauſe it's Sun-ſhine to day, there were no fear of a Storm for many dayes after.</p>
               <p>The Thoughts of Sinners, are like thoſe words of Rebellious <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Ezek. 12.27. <hi>The Viſion that he ſeeth is for many dayes to come, and he Propheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the Times that are far off.</hi> Thoſe Scoffers who walk after their own Luſts, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, in deriſion, <hi>Where is the Promiſe of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi> Where is the Promiſe, that is, where is the Threatning of his coming? The ſame word that is a Promiſe to the Saints, is often a Threatning to Sinners. Where is the Threatning of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? There hath been much Preaching and Talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Day of the Lord, of a Black Day that's coming to pay all our Scores; this hath been fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told a long time agone, even in the dayes of our Fore-fathers, who are yet gone to their Graves in peace; and behold to this day, after the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſo many Ages, we ſee no ſign of it, but all things are ſtill as they were, and Men may ſin at as cheap rates now as they did then. Thoſe Rebel Jews, <hi>Iſa</hi> 5.19. <hi>That drew Iniquity with Cords of Vanity, and Sin as it were with Cart-ropes,</hi> are ſo bold as to ſay, <hi>Let the Day of the Lord come, let it haſten that we may ſee it; let the Counſel of the Holy One of</hi> Iſrael <hi>draw nigh that we may know it.</hi> Such Infidels were theſe Rebels become, that they made the Threatnings of the Lord a meer Mock, or a Dream, or a lying Viſion, that would never come to paſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:103224:27"/>But even among thoſe that do believe that there is ſuch a day a-coming, wherein the Lord will confirm the Word of his Servants, and perform the Counſel of his Meſſengers; even amongſt them there are who ſay, Yet the Lord may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay his coming; I may have time enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent before it comes; not conſidering that though to day it be ſaid, [Time enough], yet to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the word may be [Too late, too late], though now the word be [My Lord delayeth his coming], the next word may be [He is come], the Day of the Lord is come, and I muſt no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger eſcape. O my fooliſh Soul, thou thoughteſt ſuch a day might come, but didſt thou think it ſo near? Wo, wo, unto me, the Day of Vengeance is come, in a day that I thought not of, in an hour that I was not aware, He is come, he is come, to cut me in ſunder, and to give me my Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Hypocrites. It is fallen unto me, as to ſome Women with Child, my Time is come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Reckoning was out.</p>
               <p>Friends, Is there nothing of this kind of Security alſo to be found, even among thoſe that take them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be wiſer than this Bedlam-World? How is it with many Profeſſors of Religion? Do we live in hourly expectation of the Day of Retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Are we ſo vigilant, and ſo circumſpect in our daily courſe, as Men that do believe that the Day of the Lord is at hand? How didſt thou live yeſterday? didſt thou carry it ſo as if that ſhould have been thy laſt day? How doſt thou behave thy ſelf to day? Doſt thou now carry it ſo, as if thou expectedſt to hear, <hi>This night ſhall thy Soul be taken away?</hi> Doſt thou hear daily, as if thou wert hearing thy laſt Sermon? Doſt thou pray
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:103224:28"/>
daily, as if thou wert making thy laſt Prayer? Doſt thou not ſleep daily, and ſin daily, as a Man that preſumeth on many dayes to come? Doſt thou never venture on a little ſin, or on remiſneſs in thy Duty with this thought, it will but be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting of it after? Wouldſt thou dare to do what ſometimes thou doſt, wouldſt thou dare to neglect what ſometimes thou doſt neglect, wert thou ſure there would be no time for repentance? Wouldſt thou be ſo proud as thou art, or ſo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous as thou art, or ſo vain or ſo ſlothful as thou art, if thou didſt not count upon more day before thee? Dareſt thou never lie down one night in an unrepented Sin, for fear of what may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the morning? O what Holy-Dayes, what Sabbath-Dayes would every day be, did we but daily think this may be my Judgment Day!] But doſt thou uſe to think ſo? Thou haſt thy fleſhly deſigns already laid for to morrow, and next day, and next year; to morrow thou ſayeſt, thou wilt go to ſuch a City, to buy, and to ſell, and to get gain; next day to ſuch a Fair, next day to ſuch a Feaſt, to make merry with thy Friends; and there thou goeſt, and eateſt, and drinkeſt, and tradeſt, and ſo thou meaneſt to go on from Year to Year; and all this, it may be, without ſuch a thought [if the Lord will], or [what if I ſhould not live till to morrow]. Doſt thou go up and down with thy Reckoning in thy Boſom? Is thine Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count made ready? and doſt thou carry it upon thine Heart where-ever thou goeſt? Doſt thou charge it upon thy ſelf to do nothing, but what thou wouldſt be found doing? To go no whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but where thou wouldſt that thy Lord at his coming ſhould find thee? Doſt thou uſe to ſay to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:103224:28"/>
thy ſelf, I would be loath to be found among the ſluggiſh and ſlothful Servants, among the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites and deceitful workers, among the looſe and prophane ones; and therefore take heed, O my Soul, how thou be of that number, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion with them. How can I be ſure, but if I venture to lie, or play the ſluggard or the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, but I may be found ſo doing? How can I be ſure, if I venture to have fellowſhip with the Ungodly, but I may be found among them? Thou wilt ſay, it may be, 'Tis poſſible I may be found there, but 'tis not likely I ſhall, I hope I ſhall not, and ſo for once thou wilt venture it. Why this is thy Security, thou art one of them who put the evil day from them.</p>

               <p n="1">1. One Reaſon why Men Fear not, is <hi>their Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.</hi> This I have ſpoken ſome-what of before, and ſhall therefore ſpeak the leſs now.</p>
               <p>Blind Men have moſt cauſe of Fear of any Men; if they ſtand upon never ſo ſafe ground, yet for ought they know, danger may be near. If dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger be never ſo near, and never ſo great, yet being not able to diſcover it, there's the leſs hopes of eſcaping it; whether they are in danger or out of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:103224:29"/>
danger; there's ſtill place for Fear, becauſe they know not where they are. Blind Men, of any Men, have moſt reaſon to Fear, and yet the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Blind are moſt out of Fear. Men's Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, as it puts them paſt feeling, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.18, 19. ſo it puts them paſt Fear; they have ſo little light, as not to ſee the evil that is before them, and they have ſo little wit, as not to ſuſpect the evil they ſee not.</p>
               <p>There is not any thing before them, or round about them, but they have need enough to fear it. Their very Hopes &amp; Confidences, and the Refuges that they truſt upon, if they knew what they were, would be formidable enough to them. Their Harbours in which they ſhelter themſelves, are Rocks at which they ſplit and daſh themſelves, their very Supports are their Snares.</p>
               <p>What is the Hope of the Sinner? It may be his Religion is his Hope; and what is his Religion? He believes there is a God, and is no Atheiſt; he truſts in Chriſt, and is no Infidel; he is a <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> and no <hi>Papiſt;</hi> he prayes and faſts, he is ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and honeſt, and harms no Man, and is no Publican; and this is his Righteouſneſs, upon which he ventures his Soul. But if he knew but what his Belief and his Truſt is, how far ſhort of the Faith of God's Elect; if he underſtood what his Prayers and his Faſtings are, rather Images and Shadows, than the Things themſelves; if he knew what lies and deceits, what a rotten Thread they are upon which he hangs his Hopes, and his Soul, 'twould make his Confidence his Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. But he is ignorant, and is not able to ſay, <hi>Is there not a lie in my right hand?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:103224:29"/>I would not take off Sinners from Praying and Hearing, and other Exerciſes of Religion; I would not diſgrace that little Morality, that Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, Truth, Righteouſneſs, that's found in any of them; 'twere well if all the Sinners of the Earth were Praying Sinners, and Hearing Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, if there were more morality found amongſt the Unbelieving World. Prayer is a Duty, and our way to God; Righteouſneſs is a piece of the Image of God in Man; a Jewel will ſparkle, though it be ſet in a Swine's Snout. It's pitty that they that have any thing of God, ſhould have ſo much of the Devil, that they in whom any little good is, ſhould make ſuch ill uſe of it as to undo themſelves by it. But what are the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, what is the Religion and Righteouſneſs of theſe Men? What Carnal Devotion, what a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Religion, what blind and lame and ſick Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices do they ſatisfie themſelves with? which have nothing of Truth or Spirit within, no nor ſo much as a face or form of ſerious Godlineſs without. Yea, what is their Repentance, but a cold asking forgiveneſs, without either forſaking, or ſo much as ſeriouſly confeſſing their Sins? What is their Righteouſneſs, their Innocency and Harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs, they bleſs themſelves in? It may be no more but this, they are leſs wicked than ſome others. Here is the Hope and the Truſt of theſe blind Souls; But did they underſtand what Wood, Hay, and Stubble, what broken Reeds, what Cobwebs theſe are, their very Truſt would be their Dread. But becauſe they think it's right, and ſound, becauſe they think their Sand on which they build, is a Rock; this <hi>Babel,</hi> this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed and indigeſted heap of Rubbiſh, is their
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:103224:30"/>
ſtrong Tower, becauſe they have not ſo much Light as to diſcover what Refuges of Lies theſe are; therefore 'tis that in the midſt of danger they are out of fear.</p>
               <p>The <hi>beſt</hi> of Sinners, if they underſtood it, is enough to make them afraid; and if their beſt be ſo, O what would <hi>their worſt</hi> be! If their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion be dangerous, what is their Irreligion? If there be ſo little hope in their Prayers, what is there in their mocking at Prayers? If they have reaſon to dread their Repentance, how would their Impenitence look? If what they account their Righteouſneſs will be their Ruine, what will their Wickedneſs be, what will their Oaths, and their Blaſphemies, and their Adulteries be?</p>
               <p>But what-ever they be, or what-ever danger they be in, by the one or the other, by their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices or their Sins, by their Peace in Sin, or their War with God, they know it not, and ſo go on their way in quiet and ſecure.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another Reaſon why Men Fear not, is <hi>their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief.</hi> The Belief of a God, as it will make good Men Hope, ſo it will make evil Men Fear. He that believeth that God is, can hardly but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he is the Rewarder of the Righteous and the Sinner. If there be a God, there is a Judg; He that is the Maker, is certainly the Governour of the World; and he that is their Governour, is their Judg. If there be a God, he is Holy, and therefore a lover of the Good, and hater of the Evil. If there be a God, he is Righteous, and will neither condemn the Innocent, nor hold the Wicked guiltleſs. If there be a God, he is Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcient and All-ſeeing, there can be nothing, whether Good or Evil, that can be hid from his
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:103224:30"/>
Eyes. If there be a God, he is Almighty, able to ſave and to deſtroy. As his Eye will find out, ſo by his Power he can revenge all ungodlineſs and wrong. If there be a Judg, one that is Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Righteous, All-ſeeing, and Almighty; if there be a Judg, then there ſhall be a Judgment, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in every Man muſt give an account of himſelf, and receive the reward of his doings, whether they be good or evil, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.6. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10.</p>
               <p>'Tis Mens Atheiſm that lies at the bottom of their Security in ſinning. The Devil would have found it hard work to have fill'd the World with ſo much wickedneſs, if he had not firſt filled it with Atheiſts and Infidels. Sinner, how is it that thou dareſt be as thou art, and live as thou doſt? How canſt thou eat, or drink, or ſleep, for very fear? Doſt thou not ſee how much wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thou compaſſeſt thy ſelf about withal? What are thy Sins, but ſo many Devils or worſe, and art not thou afraid of the Devil? Whether thou art or no, Remember that there is a God. Can that Holy One but hate ſuch a Beaſt as thou art? Does not the All-ſeeing One ſee thee, will not his Eye find thee out? Will not the Almighty one be too ſtrong for thee? Art thou ſtronger than he, and able to ſtand it out againſt him? Is there not a Judg to ſit upon thee, before whoſe Bar thou muſt be brought forth to anſwer for all thine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs? Shall not the Judg of all the Earth do right? Will he either deſtroy the Righteous with the wicked, or will he ſpare the wicked with the Righteous? There is a God Sinner, there is a God, believe and fear.</p>
               <p>The belief of the very being of a God, would make Sin to be feared; But what will the belief
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:103224:31"/>
of what God hath ſaid? The Word of God hath more plainly and fully declared, (beyond what might be gathered out of the bare notion of a God) what the Sinners of the Earth muſt expect to receive from his hands.</p>
               <p>Why, what is it that the Lord hath ſpoken? Search the Scriptures, that's a Book (as to impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent Sinners) like <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Roll, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2.10. Written all over with <hi>Lamentations, Mourning, and Wo.</hi> Herein is <hi>the Wrath of God revealed from Heaven, againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Men,</hi> Rom. 1.18. Who <hi>hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a day wherein he will judg the World,</hi> Acts 17.31. Who will appear <hi>in flaming Fire, rendring vengeance on them that know not God, and obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Who ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction, from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord, and from the Glory of his Power,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 1.8, 9. Who ſhall be <hi>caſt into the Lake of Fire,</hi> Rev. 20.15. Theſe and many more like words are written againſt Sinners in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God. O were this Word believed, that it is indeed the Word of God; O were this God believed, that he is not as Man, that he ſhould lye, or as the Son of Man, that he ſhould repent, but will certainly perform, and do according to all things that are written in this Book; This would make the ſtout-hearted to faint, and the ſtrong Sinner to bow down at his Feet. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of Mens unbelief, therefore the Hearts of the Sons of Men are fully and fearleſly ſet in them to do evil.</p>
               <p>O what Mettal are believing Sinners hearts made of! What, doſt thou believe the Scriptures, and yet not afraid to tranſgreſs? Believeſt thou
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:103224:31"/>
that God reſiſts the Proud, and yet does not thy Pride make thee afraid? Believeſt thou, that by thy lying, and covetouſneſs, and oppreſſion; or but by thy vain life, thy walking after the fleſh, and fulfilling the luſts thereof, thou art treaſuring up Wrath for thy ſelf againſt the Day of Wrath? and yet dareſt thou go on? canſt thou be quiet and ſecure? Sure that heart of thine is a very ſtone within thee. One would think it were not poſſible for ſuch Sinners as believe the Scriptures, but we ſhould find them all fallen upon their Faces, ſmiting upon their Thighs, ſhivering and quaking for fear of the Wrath of God, and the Judgment of the Great Day. But canſt thou hold up thine Head, and keep on thy way, and mock at Fear? Sure either thy Belief is Unbelief, thou believeſt not what thou thinkeſt thou doſt, or elſe thy heart is as the nether Milſtone.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another Reaſon why Men Fear not, is <hi>their Preſumption.</hi> As Mens Unbelief, ſo ſome Mens Belief is the Reaſon why they do not Fear. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is Belief without a Bottom, an Houſe built upon the Sand, a Spider's Web ſpun out of their own Hearts; ſtrong confidence founded on the weakneſs of a conceit, or the belief of a lye.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>There is a Preſumption of the goodneſs of their preſent State.</hi> It is ſome Mens unhappineſs, that they believe themſelves to be happy; their great
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:103224:32"/>
danger, that they believe themſelves to be out of danger. Some Unbelievers, and impenitent Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, take themſelves to be Believers and Converts to Chriſt; ſome that are the Children of Hell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve themſelves to be the Children of God. This was the caſe of thoſe Jews, <hi>John</hi> 8.39. who ſaid, with great confidence, <hi>Abraham is our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> we are the Children of Promiſe; and <hi>verſ.</hi> 41. <hi>We have one Father, even God.</hi> What-ever thou accounteſt us, we are the Children of God.</p>
               <p>And this Confidence Men ſometimes grow up unto, upon little ſearch or examining whether it be ſo or no. Nay, it may be the Reaſon is, their not examining at all how 'tis with them. Their caſe may be ſo extreamly bad and unſound, that a very little ſearch would break down all their confidence. There are multitudes that are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, 'tis well with them, upon no other ground, but becauſe they cannot tell how bad 'tis with them; and therefore they underſtand not their miſery and danger, becauſe they never ſearch'd nor look'd into themſelves, nor ever ſpent a ſerious thought about the ſtate of their Souls. It is a wonderful thing that Men can ſo eaſily ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie themſelves in ſo great a caſe, as multitudes do.</p>
               <p>Let a Miniſter of Chriſt come to deal with ſuch Perſons, let him go from Houſe to Houſe, from Man to Man, amongſt the rude and ignorant Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, how far may he go, how many may he enquire of, e're he meet with one that is ſo much as in doubt but all is well?</p>
               <p>Let him ask, How is it with your Soul? what hope have you in God? Why I doubt not, but
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:103224:32"/>
by the Grace of God my condition is good, I hope in God all is well with me.</p>
               <p>Let him go farther and ask, But are you not miſtaken? are you ſure you are not? No, I do not queſtion, but by the Grace of God, my Soul is in a good condition.</p>
               <p>Let him yet enquire, What ground and reaſon can you give of the hope that is in you? and it may be all the anſwer that will be given, amounts to no more than this, I hope becauſe I hope, I am perſwaded becauſe I am perſwaded, my Mind gives me ſo, mine Heart tells me ſo, I can have no other thought, but that it is well, and ſhall be well with me.</p>
               <p>There's many a Man that's like unto that Man pointed out <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.19. who though he heareth the words of God's Curſe, <hi>bleſſeth himſelf in his heart, ſaying, I ſhall have peace, though I walk in the imaginations of mine own heart.</hi> Though God ſpeaks never a good word, though the Scriptures ſpeak never a good word of ſuch; though God curſes ſuch a Man, yet his own heart bleſſes him. Though God ſayes to him, <hi>Thou Fool, thou Belial, thou Infidel, thou Child of the Devil, yet not a word is heard</hi> from his own heart, but, <hi>an honeſt Man, a good Chriſtian, and a Child of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is ſometimes to be found, a poor trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Chriſtian, whom the Devil ſets a curſing himſelf, when God doth bleſs him; that calls himſelf Hypocrite, Unbeliever, a Caſt-away and Reprobate from God, though God calls him Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, and highly favoured; and ſo there is that bleſſes himſelf whom God hath curſed.</p>
               <p>It's vain to tell him, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> or to bid him ſearch the Scriptures, hearken to what
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:103224:33"/>
the Lord God will ſpeak; or to ſay to him, as <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſhaphat</hi> to the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 1 Kings 22.7. enquire of the Prophet of the Lord. Doth God, his Scriptures, his Miniſters, ſpeak any good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thee? It's vain to ſpeak thus to him. <hi>Thus ſaith mine heart,</hi> is more with him, than <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord.</hi> Thus my mind gives me, is enough to make him diſ-believe the God of Truth; he will rather make God a lyar, than not believe his lying heart.</p>
               <p>Conſider this, Sinners, whether this be not your caſe; God ſayes, The Ignorant, the Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, Liars, Swearers, the evil Workers and Impenitent, are the Children of the Devil, and ſhall never inherit the Kingdom of God. And yet thou, though thou canſt not ſay but that thou art ignorant, impenitent, an evil worker, given up to thy hearts luſts, and hardned in thy way, wilt not be perſwaded but thou art a Child of God. God ſayes thou art none of his, and thou wilt ſtill ſay thou art to his Face. Juſt thus was it with thoſe Jews afore-mentioned, <hi>John</hi> 8.44. Chriſt tells them to their Faces, <hi>Ye are of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Devil;</hi> and proves it to them, for, ſaith he, <hi>The Luſts of your Father ye do;</hi> and you are juſt like your Father, he was a Murtherer from the beginning, and a Liar and the Father of it; and what elſe are you? And yet behold the confidence of the Men; No, we are <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, and the Children of God.</p>
               <p>Sinner, who-ever thou art, that art doing the Luſts, and working the Works of the Devil, Chriſt ſpeaks this very word to thee, which he here ſpake to thoſe Jews, <hi>Thou art of thy Father the Devil.</hi> If yet thou ſayeſt I hope not; God is
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:103224:33"/>
my Father, and I am his Child, there is that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption that may keep thee from fearing, till thou too late feel the Wrath of God ſeizing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee. This Preſumption, that 'tis ſo well with thee already, (that if it be poſſible I may make thee afraid of that which keeps thee from fear) know for a certain, it will endanger ſo to hold thee in thy wretched ſtate, that 'tis never like to be better with thee than 'tis. This is it which hardens thee againſt Counſels and Reproofs, ſlights the tenders of Mercy, and out-faces the terrors of the Lord; this ſhuts up thine Ears and thine Heart againſt the word of Reconciliation, and does <hi>non-plus</hi> all the importunities of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel. Let them bid thee believe, thou art a Believer already. Let them command thee to repent, Thou haſt done it; let them warn thee to flie from the Wrath to come, and this is all the Fruit, thou telleſt them thou art already paſſed from Death to Life. The confidence that thou art well enough already, is like to make the Preaching of Chriſt to be of none effect to thee.</p>
               <p>And becauſe this is ſuch a brazen Wall as keeps Chriſt and Grace out of the Heart, and reſiſts and repels all thoſe Arguments which the Word makes uſe of to perſwade to Chriſt and Life, I ſhall make ſome batteries upon it as I paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long.]</p>
               <p>The firſt ſtep to Converſion is <hi>Conviction.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction is Preſumption broken down, and the breaking in of that Fear which makes way for Faith. There are in Conviction theſe three things;

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Illumination;</hi> the enlightning of the Mind, the opening of Sinners eyes, and making their Sin, and the danger that it expoſes to, known unto them; the convincing Spirit brings the Commandment before them, by which is the knowledg of Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7. and <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>When the Commandment came, Sin revived,</hi> and <hi>appeared to be Sin, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſinful,</hi> verſ. 13. It could be no longer hid, nor any longer be look'd on as a light thing, but a very dreadful thing to be a Sinner; the truth is, we none of us know Sin as it is, ſome Light hath broken in upon our Hearts, but 'tis but little in compariſon, and thereupon we can be venturous ſo far upon it, and too eaſily go out with it, and lick our ſelves whole when we have ſinned; but if we knew the Heart and the Tail of this Scorpion; what malignity there is in it, and what comes after, 'twould make us tremble and take heed: When the Spirit of the Lord brings the Commandment to us, and layes Sin by that, 'twill look with another face than now it does.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Redargution.</hi> The Spirit of God not only ſhews what Sin is, and what a fearful thing it is to be under Sin, but withal proves and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates to Sinners, what-ever their confidence hath been of the contrary, that they are under Sin; when the Commandment hath done its work to diſcover Sin, and the evil of it, then Conſcience is brought forth to do its work, to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:103224:34"/>
witneſs the Sinner guilty. Haſt thou not ſinned? let Conſcience ſpeak; does not thine own Heart tell thee of thy Lying, and of thy Swearing, and of thy Coveting, and of thy company-keeping, and a World more of ſuch evils that thou haſt lived in? And haſt thou ever been purged from thy Sins; haſt thou repented and turned from thy evil Wayes? thou knoweſt thou haſt not; thou art in love with Sin, in a league with Sin, and liveſt to this hour in the practice, and under the power of it. Is this the Man that hath been ſo confident of the goodneſs of his ſtate, whoſe heart hath bleſſed him, and promiſed him that no evil ſhall befal him? What, a Sinner and yet at peace? What, an impenitent Sinner, and yet ſo confident thou ſhalt have peace? Thou muſt die, fooliſh Soul, thou muſt be judged and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ſuffer the vengeance of Eternal Fire; there's no ſhifting it off or eſcaping it, 'tis a plain caſe, the Evidence is full and undeniable; lay it to heart, for of a truth, thou art in an evil caſe. Here-upon as the effect of this Conviction, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Conſternation.</hi> Now the bold Sinner is knock'd in the Head and laid on his back; now his old hopes give up the Ghoſt, and Fear and Aſtoniſhment take hold upon him. This Convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Spirit, is the ſame which is called <hi>the Spirit of Bondage</hi> working Fear, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. And when he is thus broken by Fear, and feeling all his hopes and ſupports falling under him, gives himſelf for a loſt and undone Man; then he is made ready to the hand of him that comes to ſeek and to ſave that which is loſt.

               </p>
               <p>Preſumptuous Sinner, thou art never like to be happy, till thou be undone; there's no hope of thee, till thou be overcome of Fear. O cry unto the Lord to cure thee of thy confidence, to work thee to harder thoughts of thy preſent ſtate, if ever thou lookeſt it ſhould be well with thee here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. What, doſt thou yet retain thine old con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence? wilt thou yet do all thou canſt to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that good opinion of thy ſtate, which thou haſt hitherto had? what doſt thou herein do, but reſiſt that Spirit of God who would but break thee, that he might build thee up for ever? Wilt thou not be undeceived? wilt thou not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced? wilt thou never know thy danger, till it be too late to be prevented?</p>
               <p>But how ſhall I do to get mine heart awakned out of this dangerous ſtate? Why, wouldſt thou be delivered? Then,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Dread Preſumption more than ever thou dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edſt Conviction.</hi> Every hard word, every cloſe word from a Miniſter of Chriſt, how do Sinners ſhun it, and hide themſelves as much as they can from it? Fear the fair ſpeeches and ſmooth words that thy falſe heart ſpeaks to thee, more than the ſharpeſt rebukes thou receiveſt from the Mouth of God. Be willing to know the worſt of thy caſe, before it be too late to be recovered. Be afraid to be deceived, flatter not thy ſelf, and be afraid of the flatteries of others. Know it to be ſafer for thee to think worſe of thy ſelf than thou art, than to think it better than 'tis.</p>

                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:103224:35"/>1. <hi>Give heed to, and improve the convincing Word.</hi> Heb. 4.12. <hi>The Word of God is quick powerful, and ſharper than a two-edged Sword, piercing to the dividing aſunder of the Soul and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, of the Joints and Marrow, and is a diſcerner of the Thoughts and Intents of the Heart.</hi> But as quick and powerful as this Word is, yet it will not cut nor pierce unleſs it be duly heeded. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in another caſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.1. <hi>We ought to give the more earneſt heed to the things which we have heard;</hi> to every thing, to every word that the Lord ſpeaks; not only to his ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſofter words, his promiſing and comforting words, but to his ſharper and harder words, his convincing and threatning words; every word of God is needed by us, and no word will do its work if it be not heeded.</p>
               <p>Thou ſhouldſt, when thou heareſt ſuch words as theſe, <hi>He that committeth Sin is of the Devil. He that doth not Righteouſneſs is not of God. The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God. He that walketh after the Fleſh ſhall die. He that hath not the Spirit of Chriſt is none of his. If any Man love the World, the love of the Father abides not in him. Except a Man be born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God. Except ye repent, ye ſhall all periſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thou ſhouldſt, when thou heareſt ſuch words, conſider whoſe words are theſe; Is not this the Word of the Lord? Thou ſhouldſt bethink thy ſelf, to whom doth the Lord ſpeak thus? Is it not to me? Am not I one of this number? Am not I Unrighteous? Am not I a Servant of my Fleſh? Hath not my Life been a wicked Life, a worldly Life, a meer carnal Life? Have I been born again, and become a new Creature? Have
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:103224:36"/>
I the Spirit of Chriſt? Is this proud Spirit, this froward Spirit, this vain Spirit, this lying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious Spirit, is this the Spirit of Chriſt? Have I repented of my Sins, and returned from my ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and fooliſh wayes? Speak, O my Conſcience, do not lye to me, but tell me truth, how doſt thou find it? Sure I have been a Sinner, and a worldly and wicked liver, and I cannot find that I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, or been new-Born, and become a new Creature to this day. How then can I conclude, but that God hath ſpoken this word to me, <hi>Thou art the Man</hi> that ſhall die, and ſhall not ſee the Kingdom of God? And how canſt thou but take theſe words from his Mouth into thine own, and confeſs, <hi>I am the Man?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Pray for the Convincing Spirit.</hi> The Word without the Spirit can do nothing, neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince nor comfort thee: When God ſent a Word into the World, he ſent his Spirit along with it to make it proſper. He was promiſed to be ſent to this very end, amongſt others, <hi>to Convince the World of Sin,</hi> John 16.8. O pray for this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; when thou heareſt a word that ſtrikes upon thy ſore, lift up thine Heart to the Lord, let thy Spirit, thine Almighty Spirit, ſet home this Word upon mine Heart. I hear ſuch a word as makes both mine Ears to tingle, and I cannot deny but it belongs to me; but for mine Heart, I cannot get it to ſtick; let the Spirit of the Lord ſharpen this Nail, and drive it home. Here's a poor Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter does what he can, ſpeaks as plainly, as cloſely, and as powerfully as he is able, does what he can to ſtartle me, and to humble me, and break me; But, poor Man, he cannot do it, this Heart is too deep for him to reach it, too hard for him to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:103224:36"/>
pierce it; But where is the God of mine Heart? O let the Spirit of the Lord take the Pulpit, and ſet an edge upon this two-edged Sword, that its Iron may enter into my Soul. Cry thus unto the Lord; Say not as once <hi>Iſrael</hi> did, Let not the Lord ſpeak to us any more, but let <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeak; Let this be thy Prayer, Let <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeak, and the Prophets, and Paſtors, and Teachers ſpeak, but let the Lord ſpeak alſo, and then there's hope I may hear.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Receive and retain the convincing Word, when it comes.</hi> Do not pray, Lord ſpeak, and then turn away the Ear; Lord come in, and then ſhut the door againſt him; pray for the Holy Ghoſt, and then ſee, that you reſiſt not the Holy Ghoſt. What the Apoſtle adviſes concerning the word of Exhortation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.22. <hi>[Suffer] the Word of Exhortation,</hi> will be much more needed here, ſuffer the Word of Conviction. It is a Word that will not be ſuffered by them that need it moſt. The proud and ſtubborn heart, either riſes and ſwells, and flings it back in the Preacher's Face, or at leaſt it builds a Fort againſt it; ſometimes a Fort of Unbelief; I cannot believe my caſe is ſo bad; and ſometimes a Fort of Faith, (ſuch a Faith as 'tis) I believe in Chriſt, and therefore as wicked as I am, through him I hope to be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Friends, give the Word a free paſſage, let it have entrance into your Hearts; and how hot work ſoever it makes there, let it abide till it hath finiſhed its Work. Give it time, hold upon thine Heart the ſenſe of the miſery and danger, the Word hath brought thee to, till the end be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The ſharpeſt Plaiſter will not raiſe a Bliſter as ſoon as it's clap'd on, it muſt have time to work; and though it ſmart, it muſt be kept on
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:103224:37"/>
till the work be done. Some Fooliſh Patients, if it put them to pain, will tear it off and throw it away. Sinner, hath the Word ſmitten thee, and cut thee to the heart? hath it made thee raw, and clap'd on a Plaiſter of Fire, the ſenſe of Wrath and Judgment? Hath it made thee, who once wert a ſtrong confident, and wouldſt not ſuſpect but thou wert in a ſafe and happy ſtate; hath it made thee now to feel the Wrath of God abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon thee? Doſt thou feel thy Peace broken, thy Hopes and thy Carnal Confidence broken down? Make them ſure, never let them be built again; beware how thou ever recover to thy old Preſumption again, but hold that Fear upon thy heart, till there be a. new and a ſure Foundation laid, upon which thou mayeſt be built up in hope of Eternal Life.</p>
               <p>Some fooliſh Sinners, when God hath diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their unſoundneſs, and afrighted them with thoſe dreadful Conſequents that they ſee running in upon them like a Flood, their deſires and endeavours are after preſent eaſe and quiet; if they can make a ſhift to be at reſt and at eaſe for the preſent, (however it may be with them here-after) that's all they look after; they are more for hiding themſelves from their Fears, than from their Danger; and glad they would be, if they could but get them back into their former ſtate, wherein they felt no trouble, nor fear'd any evil. Some ſmitten Sinners, that are purſu'd by the Terrors of the Lord, will often do, as the ſtricken Deer that's hunted by the Dogs, he'l thruſt himſelf, if it be poſſible, among the Herd, that there the Dogs may loſe him. When the Word hath terrified a Sinner, and Conſcience
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:103224:37"/>
dogs him at the heels, ſo that he can be no-where at reſt, away he will into the Herd amongſt his Companions, with whom he was uſed to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in hope to forget his trouble; his Carnal Friends will adviſe him, and he's ready enough to take their advice, to try what he can do, to drink away ſorrow, and laugh away all his trouble; and this, it may be, may yeeld him a preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, yea, and reduce him to a more ſecure and ſenſleſs ſtate than ever before, wherein he may abide, and never know fear or trouble more, till he be brought to the King of Terrors, and all the evils he formerly feared, be come upon him to the uttermoſt, and he can no longer eſcape.</p>
               <p>Beware of this folly, Sinner; Hath God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced thee of thy Sin, and thy Danger, and pierced thy very Entrals, with a ſenſe of that Wrath that hangs over thy head? Do not ſeek eaſe, in any other way, but by the removal of the cauſe of thy Fears. Be not ſuch a Child as to think of hiding thy ſelf from danger, by ſhutting thine eyes from ſeeing it. 'Tis a poor Cure of a Diſeaſe, thy being laid to ſleep, that thou mayeſt feel no pain.</p>
               <p>Beware of running into the Herd again for eaſe: When God hath ſmitten thee, wilt thou to the Devil for a Cure? Keep thy Sore open, and do not skin it over, whilſt the Core ſtill remains within. Sinner, thou wert once far from fear or trouble; thou couldſt once follow the World, and follow thy Sins, and live in a conſtant neglect of God and thy Soul, and nothing of all this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled thee: Is this the ſtate thou wouldſt return to? Is it not ſafer to be a wounded than a ſecure Sinner? an awakned than a ſleeping Sinner?
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:103224:38"/>
Chuſe rather to live in God's Fire, than the Devils Mud; in God's Purgatory, than in the Devil's Paradiſe. Wilt thou rather die of thy Lethargy, than endure thoſe cuttings and ſcarifyings which might ſave thy Life? If thou art for eaſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be to Life or Death; or if thou wouldſt purchaſe thy Peace on ſuch terms as thine ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Ruine, then return to thy ſecure Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous State.</p>

Sure I am afraid of thee.</p>
                  <p>I will not ſay, how it may be with here and there one of the moſt grown and experienced Chriſtians, thoſe of the firſt and higheſt Form in the School of Chriſt, but for ſuch as are but new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come in, or what-ever their ſtanding be, are but of low ſtature; by how much the more out of doubt they are, by ſo much the more it is to be doubted that they deceive themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>To anſwer more particularly. There are more miſtakes than one that Profeſſors of Religion may be ſubject to.</hi>

                  </list>
                  <p>I ſhall ſpeak more at large to this afterwards, yet this word or two I ſhall put in here.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>They may be miſtaken in Faith, and count that to be Saving-Faith which is not ſo.</hi> That definition of Faith given by ſome <hi>Antinomians, That it is a believing that we are juſtified and ſhall be ſaved,</hi> hath doubtleſs deceived many. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>If this be Saving-Faith, then one of theſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities will unavoidably follow; either that all Men are not bound to believe, with a Saving-Faith, or that ſome Men are bound to believe a lye.</hi> Is there any Man, to whom the Goſpel is Preached, that is not bound to believe in Chriſt? Is it not their Sin, who refuſe Chriſt when he is tendred to them? Let theſe two Scriptures be conſidered, 1 John 3.23. <hi>This is the Commandment, that we ſhould believe in the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and <hi>Job.</hi> 16.9. <hi>He ſhall reprove the World—of Sin, becauſe they believe not in me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if all Men be bound to believe, and this be that belief they be bound to, to be perſwaded they ſhall be ſaved; how can it be avoided, but that ſome are bound to believe a lye? Are all Men in a ſtate of Salvation? Are all the Children of God? Hath the Devil never a Child in the World? Not one, if this Doctrine be true, that all are bound to believe they ſhall be ſaved, and yet none are bound to believe a lye.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>If this be Saving-Faith, then happy are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of the ungodly World.</hi> Who more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:103224:39"/>
that they ſhall be ſaved, than many ignorant and impenitent Sinners, amongſt whom the firſt and moſt difficult Work of the Miniſtry lies in this, to break down their vain Confidence? Much of our hardeſt work might be ſaved, if we found the Sinners of the Earth under a deſperation of Salvation in their preſent cſes. 'Tis this that is the great block in our way, and keeps back our Word from reaching their Hearts, that they will not be perſwaded otherwiſe, but they ſhall to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when they die.</p>
                  <p>But ſhall they be ſaved indeed who believe they ſhall? what, every one of them, the believing Hypocrite, the believing Drunkard, the believing Impenitent, even the very final Impenitent? Can Charity it ſelf be ſo blind, as to think that not one of thoſe Confidents ever died impenitent? And can this be counted the Goſpel-Faith, that will juſtifie final Impenitents?</p>
                  <p>Come ye Hypocrites, come ye Earth-worms, come ye blind and bruitiſh among the People, lift up your Ears and Heads, here is a Goſpel (if it were but true) according to your own hearts; <hi>Fear not to be as wicked as you will, only believe you ſhall be ſaved, and you ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But is this Goſpel? I know the conſequences of this Doctrine will be abhorred by its Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; But how can they be evaded?</p>
                  <p>Divers other Errors there are concerning Faith, which may lead Men into damnable miſtakes, too long to mention.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Although they have the true Notion of Faith, yet they may be miſtaken in themſelves.</hi> They may think they have it when they have it not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:103224:40"/>There are not a few, amongſt thoſe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs Religion, who underſtand aright what Faith is, what a real Work of Grace means, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Truth of Chriſtianity ſtands, who yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not their own hearts. There are who do not think that to be ſomething which is nothing, who yet may be of thoſe of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.3. who <hi>think themſelves to be ſomething when they are nothing,</hi> and ſo deceive their own ſelves. The Heart of Man is deep and dark, who can know it? <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9. we have need of other Light than our own, the ſearcher of Hearts alone can help us to underſtand what there is within us.</p>
                  <p>The Heart of Man hath many Devices, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.21. it hath ſo much folly, as to ſtudy to make the beſt of its caſe, being loth to ſee the worſt; and it hath ſo much ſubtilty, as to put the beſt ſide outwards, and to hide the worſt out of ſight. Many Mens great labour in Religion, is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelves that all is well; inſtead of a plain-hearted and impartial enquiry, whether they be upright or no, their buſineſs is, only to ſtudy Arguments to prove they are ſo. They will ſearch out all the Arguments they can imagine for it, but they dare not look too far into the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt it. We would fain comfort our hearts, and thereupon greedily catch at every ſhadow that looks well, but dare not criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally examine that which ſeems to ſpeak good concerning us, whether it ſpeak truth or no. The great queſtion is, whether there be Grace in our Hearts or no? and we are ſo willing to believe there is, that we dare not look too deep, leſt we ſhould find there is none. The labour and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:103224:40"/>
that a conviction of our unſoundneſs would put us to, is ſo unpleaſing to us, that we do all we can to ſave our ſelves that trouble. If we be ſound, we think the work is done; now we may ſing, <hi>Return to thy Reſt O my Soul,</hi> but if I ſhould find my ſelf to be ſhort of ſincerity, how much labour would it require to get to be ſincere?</p>
                  <p>Now hereupon, the heart being ſo partial and overly in ſtudying its caſe, what wonder is it that it ſhould be deceived and miſtaken? what wonder is it that he ſhould think himſelf ſomething, who is nothing, who is too willing, and hath ſo many devices to make his nothing look like ſomething? And that it is ſo, that there are many that are thus deceived, there is too great evidence in the World.</p>
                  <p>There are many that can deceive none but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and yet themſelves they can deceive. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that ſees them, ſees the very marks of an Hypocrite upon them; no body can think well of them but themſelves. They have taken to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Name, and have ſomething of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of the Children of God, yet their ſpot is not the ſpot of his Children. Their Complexion is rather a Paint than their natural Viſage, and their ſpot looks out through their Paint. Whilſt there is the Profeſſion of a Chriſtian, of the Faith of a Chriſtian, of the Hope of a Chriſtian, what is there to be ſeen of the Holineſs of a Chriſtian? if there be a Paint of the Holineſs too, yet he that obſerves it, may ſee Sin looking through it. The Humility that appears, the Meekneſs, the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality, the Heavenlineſs of Mind, are all but a varniſh. The Leproſie that hath fretted and eaten into the Wall, will break out through the Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, wherewith it's whited over. It's poſſible it's
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:103224:41"/>
true, that others may be deceived in them alſo; theſe Pictures may be ſo drawn to the Life, that every one may take them to be living Souls, and yet while they have a Name that they live, they may be dead, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Grace is Truth;</hi> a real thing, not a ſhadow or paint. This Truth is in the inward parts originally; <hi>Thou loveſt Truth in the inward parts,</hi> Pſal. 51.6. [thou loveſt Truth] not Shadows or Images, but Realities [thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt Truth in the inward parts] inſide Truth, a true Heart, a pure Conſcience; he is a Chriſtian which is one inwardly, <hi>Rom</hi> 2.29.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Grace is Life,</hi> the Life of God 'tis called, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.18. It is a Vital Power, that forms the Heart into the Image of God, that ſpirits and acts the whole Man, and that exerts and produces thoſe Vital Operations which are according to God, and reſiſts and works out that corruption which is contrary to God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Grace is a Law;</hi> a Law in the Heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. that commands and governs both it and the Life, contradicts and overcomes that evil Law, the Law of Sin that wars in the Members.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Grace is the fixing of the Heart upon God;</hi> the returning and coming back of the Soul from that vanity, after which it had luſted and gone awho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and the pitching of it upon him as the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of all its Hopes, Aims, Deſires, and Motions. It comes down from Above, even from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Lights, and it fetches up the heart to him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Grace is the healing of Nature;</hi> our participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Divine Nature, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Holineſs in the Heart, which is the health of the Soul, and whereby it purgeth it ſelf of all
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:103224:41"/>
that corruption wherewith it was leavened and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and is reduced to that better Temperament from which by Sin it fell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Grace is the eſtabliſhment of the Heart in Good, Heb.</hi> 13.9. the firmneſs of the Soul; its being wrought to a good conſiſtency; it does not leave the Soul hovering, and wavering, and hanging betwixt Good and Evil, but unalterably, though not perfectly, ſettles it upon Holineſs and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. Though there be degrees in firmneſs, ſome weaker Chriſtians are but unſtable Souls, in compariſon of thoſe that are more deeply rooted, and more ſtrongly fixed upon God and Godlineſs, yet the very weakeſt of real Chriſtians, are ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterably fixed upon God, and his holy Wayes, that nothing in the World can ſo far change their Minds, as wholly to bring them back; but the main bent of their Hearts and Courſe is ſtill for Holineſs and Righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>Now are there none among the Profeſſors of Religion that know all this, and much more, yea, and feel ſomething within which they judg to be the Babe ſpringing in the Womb, the Life of God begotten in them, the New Creature brought to the Birth and brought forth; in whom all this is but a falſe Conception, and proves an Abortion at laſt?</p>
                  <p>Brethren, ſince there may be ſuch miſtakes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the taking that for Faith or Grace which is not ſo, or the taking your ſelves to have it within you when it is not there, (many have been thus miſtaken, damnably miſtaken, have gone down to the Chambers of Death, full of the hopes of Eternal Life) ſince it may be thus, beware that none of you be thus miſtaken.] Beware of taking
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:103224:42"/>
that for the Faith which will ſave your Souls, which doth not ſave you from your Sins. Beware of venturing your Lives upon the ſtrongeſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, that Chriſt is your Life, eſpecially while you find that Sin is not dead. Beware of truſting to an out-ſide Chriſtianity, that dwells in the Head or upon the Tongue, whilſt the Fleſh and the World ſtill have the poſſeſſion of the Heart. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of truſting to that Godlineſs which hath ſomewhat touched and affected the Heart, but is but ſlight and ſhallow, and is not gotten deep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Soul. Beware of truſting to that for Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that is but a weak and feeble thing, that hath no life nor power in it, but is a dead thing, that doth not put forth it ſelf in Vital Operations, that is over-top'd and held captive by the Law of your Members; that is made uſe of to comfort you, but is not ſuffered to govern you, but is kept as an underling, and made to ſtand aſide and give place to the Pleaſures and Inclinations of your Fleſh, that is laid up to help you in your need, and till then laid by, that it hinder you not in your Carnal Intereſts or Deſigns.</p>
                  <p>Take heed of counting that your Grace, which leaves you under the power of your old depraved Natures. Is not thy natural pride and haughtineſs ſubdued? Doſt thou continue froward, envious, of a fleſhly and earthly heart, as thou waſt uſed to be? doth the old Stream run ſtill? or if it be at times bayed up, doth it ordinarily break down the Bay and run its wonted courſe? Fear that Grace that is thus overpowred by Nature.</p>
                  <p>Truſt not to that for Grace, which is a wavering, in and out thing; that hath no conſiſtency in it, but leaves thee a ductile ſequacious Soul, carried
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:103224:42"/>
about hither and thither with every Wind, and apt to be variouſly ſnap'd, according to the ſeveral temptations or circumſtances thou art in. Some Mens Godlineſs keeps pace with the Times, is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Wing, or hangs the Wing, according to the encouragement or diſcountenance of the dayes they live in. If Religion hath gotten the Wind on its ſide, then they go on proſperouſly, and hang forth all their Sails, and will as ſoon ſtrike Sail when the Wind is contrary. Some are Holy on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Affliction; when they are low and in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when they are ſick and in pain, and like to die, then O what complaining of Sin, what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendings to Repentance, what breathings after Grace; then Reading, and Praying, and Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Diſcourſes about the other World come in requeſt; but when they proſper again, and are in health, all their Religion is laid by and forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. Others are Godly only when they are pleaſed, and all goes ſmoothly on with them. Every lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle guſt of Affliction blows all their Grace off its legs. Some Mens Religion is much according to what their Company is. Who more zealous, and ſavoury and lively, when they fall in amongſt the Zealous? and yet at other times, as flat, and as carnal, and as vain as others, ſcarce a Thought or a Word of any thing that good is, when it will diſguſt the Company.</p>
                  <p>If this be all the Religion thou haſt, take heed of venturing thy Soul upon it, or of growing confident that this is Grace or Godlineſs.</p>
                  <p>And that which is Grace indeed, that Truth in the Inward Parts, that Life of God, that new Law in the Heart, that fixedneſs upon God, that health and that firmneſs of the Soul in Good; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware

you count not your ſelves to have attained it before you have. Be ſure before you be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, whilſt the caſe is doubtful, ſuſpect your ſelves; whilſt you hope the beſt, fear the worſt. Put it out of doubt, by ſearching more narrowly, and a more diligent improving. True Grace, where 'tis weak, is hardly diſcernable, the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweſt ſearch will not do it. What-ever Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments there may be for, there will be ſo many Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt it, that will darken the evidence of them. The Confidence of a <hi>truly gracious Soul,</hi> that is but weak, may be a kind of Preſumption, though he doth not preſume, he hath what he hath not; though he hath it indeed, yet his Confidence that he hath it, may be a kind of Preſumption, becauſe the Evidence is not ſo clear that he can ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally bottom a peremptory concluſion upon it.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this matter; Art thou perſwaded that thou haſt Faith, and that there is a gracious ſaving change wrought upon thee? Fear that thou mayeſt be miſtaken; and in this Fear, ſearch whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou art miſtaken or no, leſt thou alſo at laſt ſhould be found, and have thy portion with the Preſumptuous and ſelf-deceiving Souls. But of this more in its place.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>There is a Preſumption on future Mercy, how bad ſoever Mens preſent condition be.</hi> There are ſome ſelf-condemned Perſons the Die of whoſe Sins is ſo deep, that it cannot be varniſhed over, nor hid from their own eyes; their Conſciences paſs Sentence upon them for Hypocrites and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly; and yet, though they ſee they be ſtark naught, abominable Branches, reprobate Silver at preſent, they are ſtill without Fears, but it ſhall
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:103224:43"/>
be well with them hereafter. Though their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences condemn them, yet they hope God will juſtifie them. Conſcience charges them as God did thoſe ungodly ones, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.17. <hi>Thou bateſt Inſtruction, and caſteth the Word of the Lord behind thee; when thou ſaweſt a Thief, thou conſentedst to him, and haſt been partaker with the Adulterer.</hi> Thou haſt been a Thief, an Adulterer, a Lyar, a Scoffer, a Slanderer, theſe things thou haſt done; Canſt thou deny it? Or as <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.23. <hi>How canſt thou ſay I am not polluted?</hi> How canſt thou ſay I am not a Tranſgreſſor? <hi>See thy way in the Valley,</hi> trace thy Foot-ſteps, conſider the courſe of thy Life, and ſee if all thy wayes do not ſpeak thee a wicked Man. But though Conſcience charges them thus, and they cannot deny the Charge, but are forc'd to acknowledg all is true, and to confeſs, if there be ever a wicked Man in the World, I am one; if there be ever a vile Perſon in the Earth, I am one; if there be ever a graceleſs one under Heaven, I am the Man: yet though they know that they are wicked Ones, and have no Grace at preſent, they ſtill preſume they ſhall have Mercy at laſt. God is a God of Pardons, if he ſhould be extream to mark Iniquities, who then ſhall ſtand? God is a merciful God; for whom did Chriſt die but for Sinners? Wo be to the World if God were no more merciful, if Chriſt were no more gracious than Men ſpeak.</p>
                  <p>This was the Confidence of thoſe pointed at before, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.19. <hi>Who bleſs themſelves in their Hearts, ſaying, I ſhall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine own heart, and add drunkenneſs unto thirſt.</hi> Mich. 3.11. <hi>The heads of the People judg for Reward, the Prieſts thereof teach

                  <p>This is a more common caſe than is imagined; Men could not be ſo hardy nor ſo venturous upon a courſe of known Iniquity, as we ſee them to be, did they not maintain in their hearts a ſecret hope of Mercy; yet I ſhall have Pardon, yet I ſhall have Peace, the Lord I truſt will ſpare me, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all that I have done.

                  <p>If there were any ground for ſuch an hope, we muſt quite invert the Goſpel; and whilſt the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tells us, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>The Grace of God, which bringeth Salvation, hath appeared to all Men, teaching us, that denying ungodlineſs and worldly Luſts, we ſhould live righteouſly, and ſoberly, and godly in this preſent World;</hi> It muſt be now writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for Goſpel, The Grace of God teacheth us to deny all Godlineſs, and to indulge to worldly Luſts, and to live wickedly, and filthily, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlily in this preſent World, and yet ſtill to look for the Bleſſed Hope, and the glorious Appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. Is this the Doctrine of Chriſt? It muſt be ſo or thou art undone. And if it be, what difference betwixt the Doctrine of Chriſt, and the Doctrine of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils?</p>

                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:103224:45"/>Preſumptuous Sinner, ſtand and tremble. If the Word of God be not a lye, If the Holy Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus came not to build, but to deſtroy the Works of the Devil, there's no hope for thee, but if thou continueſt thus thou muſt periſh for ever.</p>
                  <p>Who ſhall bring thee into the Holy City? who ſhall intercede and appear before God for thee? Will Chriſt do it? will he ever bring up the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Devil, and ſet them before the Throne of God, and ſay concerning them, Theſe are my Redeemed Ones? Theſe Lyars, theſe evil Beaſts, theſe ſlow Bellies, theſe Wantons, theſe Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms, theſe blind and bruitiſh Souls, theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels that all their life-time ſet at nought all my Counſels, and rejected my Salvation, theſe are mine, I pray thee ſet the Crown upon their Heads, for they are worthy? Will Chriſt ever preſent ſuch a Brood as theſe to his Father? Will he plead for entrance for ſuch as theſe? Canſt thou imagine that Chriſt would not bluſh and be aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to bring ſuch an unclean thing as thou art be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Father at laſt, and ſay, This is my Child, I pray thee let him live in thy ſight? Will he ſay to the Father, O that <hi>Iſhmael</hi> might live before thee? that theſe Bond-men, and Baſtards, and <hi>Belials,</hi> that never knew thee, nor car'd for thee, that never minded any ſuch thing as Religion and Godlineſs in the World, but mocked and ſcoffed at all that did, that would never be perſwaded to ſeek the Lord, or ſerve the Lord, but all their life long, gave themſelves up to ſerve their Luſts and the Devil, Let there be an entrance for theſe into the Everlaſting Kingdom? as black as they are, and as reſolute as they were, never to be waſh'd and made white with the Blood of the Lamb, yet
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:103224:46"/>
they are mine, take them in. Sinner, if it were poſſible that Chriſt ſhould thus plead for thee, (if thou be found in that day in the caſe that now thou art) by all the Power and Intereſt he hath in Heaven, he could not prevail for thee. He might as well prevail for <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> yea, for <hi>Beel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub</hi> himſelf, with all thoſe black Legions which are already in Hell, and fetch them up from the Deep to ſit upon Thrones of Glory, as ever he could prevail for thee. 'Tis againſt the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Counſel and Purpoſe of God, againſt the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and Tenour of the Goſpel of Grace; Chriſt had never any Commiſſion from his Father, to ſave or ſpeak one word for any one Soul that lives and dies in his ſins.</p>

unuſual, that it's utterly improbable, that thou that haſt been ſinning all thy life, in Preſumption upon Repentance in thy laſt hour, ſhouldſt not then find it flying as far from thee, as thou doſt now from it.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>We have reaſon to Fear becauſe of our Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi> Mens Ignorance is the reaſon why they Fear not, (as before) and yet it's a great reaſon why they ſhould Fear. Who have ſo great reaſon to fear as the Blind? Every Buſh may be a Thief, every Sheep may be a Wolf, every Lamb may be a Lion; for ought he ſees to the contrary, every ſtep may be into the Ditch, or into the Fire, or into the Water; where-ever he ſtands, or ſits, or dwells, he knows not who or what may be near him; and have not ſuch Men reaſon to Fear?

                  <item>2. <hi>We know not the Dangers that are in our way.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>We know not our way.</hi> John 12.35. <hi>He that walketh in darkneſs, knoweth not whither he goeth.</hi> Whither art thou bound Soul? Thou art a Traveller, but to what City, to what Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey art thou travelling? O, I am going to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> to the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> I am travelling Heavenwards. But doſt thou know the way to that good Land? Some of the moſt ignorant will anſwer, as Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>Wither I go I know, and the way I know;</hi> when the truth is, they neither underſtand the one nor the other.</p>
               <p>The way to God, though it be a ſtrait way, and leads directly on by a line, yet it's hard to hit upon. If I were to give but one general directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for finding the way to Heaven, this ſhould be it; Take your firſt turning upon the right hand, and then keep ſtrait on, without turning either to the right hand or to the left. The way that thou art now going is to Hell, but there is a turning on the right hand juſt before thee; <hi>Repentance,</hi> which is our turning out of the way of Death, into the way of Life; take that turning, and then turn no more, but keep ſtrait on to the end of thy Life.</p>
               <p>But as ſtrait a way as the way of Life is, it is not ſo eaſie to keep us in it. There are many turnings out on either hand; and at every Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtands a Deceiver, calling to Paſſengers as they go, Turn in hither, this is the way, walk in it. The <hi>Phariſee</hi> ſtands at one Turning, and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:103224:48"/>
ſayes, This is the way, The Law of Carnal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, the formal and ſuperſtitious obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Externals of Religion. The <hi>Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Zealot</hi> ſtands at another, and ſayes, This is the way, The Spirituals of Religion, believe in Chriſt, love God, and then live to thy ſelf. The <hi>Sectary,</hi> of whatſoever Sect he be, ſayes, Here is Chriſt, this is the way of Life, turn in hither, be one of Us and thou ſhalt do well. The <hi>Fleſh</hi> ſtands and cries, Hearken to none of theſe, they are all blind Guides, and will lead thee into their own Ditch; come take this great and beaten Road in which thy Fore-fathers have gone before thee; Follow the Wiſe Men, and the Learned Men, and thoſe multitudes that thou ſeeſt going before thee; Truſt in the Mercy of God and trouble thy ſelf no farther. And the <hi>Devil</hi> ſtands at every one of theſe Turnings; and if he can but perſwade thee to take one of them, it comes much alike to him which it be.</p>
               <p>Now what ſhall a poor ignorant Soul do in this caſe to hit the right, when there are ſo many falſe wayes? He does not know the way himſelf, and he is like to meet with ſo many falſe Guides, how can he but Fear he may be miſled and loſt?</p>
               <p>It fares with theſe Ignorant Souls, as with the Hoſts of the <hi>Syrians,</hi> that were going to <hi>Dathan</hi> to ſlay <hi>Eliſha,</hi> 2 Kings 6.19. <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſmites them with blindneſs, and then leads them whitherſoever he pleaſes. Out he goes to them and tells them, This is not the way, neither is this the City, come along with me and I will bring you to the Man whom you ſeek, but he led them to <hi>Samaria.</hi> This blind Hoſt thought they had been right, and going to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:103224:48"/>
                  <hi>Dathan;</hi> but when their eyes were opened, they ſaw themſelves betrayed into <hi>Samaria,</hi> into the hands of their Enemies. Poor blind Soul, thy hope is Heaven, that's thy journeys end, thy Home to which thou ſayest thou art travelling; and thou perſwadeſt thy ſelf thou art in the way thither, but for all this thou mayeſt be miſtaken, thou mayeſt be going to <hi>Samaria,</hi> to <hi>Sodom,</hi> to Hell and not to Heaven, thou art in darkneſs, and knoweſt not whither thou goeſt; thou doſt not know thy way, how then canſt thou but fear whether thou art in the right way or the wrong?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>By reaſon of Ignorance, we know not the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in our way.</hi> If we have ſome apprehenſion that the way is dangerous, yet we know not in particular where the danger lies, and ſo, ere we are aware, may fall into it. Some young Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, though they be told they be going a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Road, yet know not the dangerous Places, nor the dangerous Perſons that they fall upon; a Thief ſtarts up out of a Buſh where they never ſuſpected him, and when he comes, by his fair Language and Carriage, they take him for a Friend, and ſuſpect not he comes upon any evil Intention, till their loſs too late teach them what he is.</p>
               <p>What harm is there in ſuch a vain faſhion, in ſuch a queſtionable recreation, in Cardings, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings, Dancings? What harm is there in a little carnal Mirth, or in vain and merry Company? they be not Drunkards, nor Swearers, nor Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers; there's nothing amongſt them but honeſt mirth and pleaſantneſs, what hurt is there in that? why, what harm is there in falling among Thieves? what harm is there in being rob'd of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:103224:49"/>
all thou haſt? haſt thou never been a loſer by ſuch friendly Thieves? haſt thou loſt none of thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Time amongſt them, which thou couldſt ill ſpare? nay, have they not ſtollen away thy heart? It may be thou haſt found thou wert of a better Spirit, when thou cameſt amongſt them, thou hadſt ſome ſenſe and ſavour of God and Religion upon thine heart, and ſome holy ſeriouſneſs and tenderneſs; and when thou returneſt, thou ſeeſt it's loſt, thou haſt left all thy Religion behind thee. Is this no harm; when thou hadſt been ſerv'd ſo once, wouldſt thou be content to be ſerv'd ſo again?</p>
               <p>If thou hadſt a cup of pleaſant Wine before thee, and one ſhould tell thee, Take heed, there's poiſon in the Cup, wouldſt thou ſay, what harm is it if there be? If one ſhould meet thee in a Wood or a Deſert, and ſhould offer thee Money, or Pleaſure, or what-ever thou wilt; if thou wilt be rul'd by him, and do what he would have thee; and a Friend ſhould tell thee, this may be the Devil that comes to truck with thee for thy Soul? wouldſt thou ſay, what harm is it if it be the Devil? what harm will it be to take his Money or his Pleaſure?</p>
               <p>Why this may be the caſe; In all thoſe little things (as thou counteſt them) there may be poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Cup, there may be the Devil in the Company; the Pleaſures that are before thee, the Money that is before thee, theſe may be the price the Devil is offering thee for thy life. May it be ſo? I, but I do not think 'tis ſo, my Soul may be ſafe enough for all that; why therefore fear that there may be ſuch danger, and you never know or ſuſpect it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:103224:49"/>Nay, this Devil lies ſtill in wait, not only in thoſe places and wayes, which look like ſuſpicious places and ſuſpicious ways; but he's every-where at hand, even where he is leaſt ſuſpected. When could Men think themſelves more ſecure from the Devil, than when they are <hi>with God</hi> in Duties and Ordinances? But doth he never meet them there? Hath the Devil never met thee in thy Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, or in the Congregation of the Lord? How is it at this very hour? Now that we are come together before the Lord, now that the Lord is inſtructing us, and warning us of the danger we are in; Is there not one ſtanding behind, and out of ſight, either ſtealing away your hearts from minding the Warnings, or elſe contradicting the Word of the Lord? Come, ccme, theſe are but words and conceits, the Devil is far enough off, thou art in no ſuch danger of him; are there no ſuch whiſperings in none of your ears at this time? Why, whoſe Voice is this? you little think whoſe 'tis; 'Tis the Devil that thus ſpeaks, to the end you may loſe this Warning, and ſo he may have his advantage upon you. <hi>Lord open the eyes of theſe Men,</hi> (to uſe that Prayer for you, which the Man of God did for his Servant, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.17.) So the Lord opened his eyes, and he ſaw all the Mountains full of Angels, Chariots of Fire, and Horſes of Fire. If God ſhould ſo open our eyes, I truſt we ſhould ſee this Houſe full of the Angels of God miniſtring to us, but withal we ſhould ſee this Houſe full of Devils attempting to miſchief us; a Devil at every Ear, a Devil at every Heart, trying his skill to ſtop the one and harden the other, from receiving this Word of the Lord. We are never an one of us more ſecure, than <hi>Joſhua</hi>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:103224:50"/>
the High-Prieſt, of whom we read, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3.1. That when he was <hi>ſtanding before the Lord, Satan ſtood at his right hand to reſist him.</hi> You'l ſay again, it may be, you do not think 'tis ſo, why therefore Fear, that the Devil ſhould be ſo near, and ſo buſie with you, and you neither underſtand, nor will believe it though it be told you. Such Ignorance is cauſe enough of Fear.</p>
               <p>If any of you ſhould have been told, ten or twenty years ago, how the Devil would ſerve you, how he would hinder any word of Counſel or Inſtruction from proſpering with you, how he would hold you under this Ignorance of God, and hardneſs and impenitence of Heart; you would have been like enough to anſwer, I hope not, I hope to get more of the knowledg of God, I hope God will bring me to Repentance one time or other, I hope his Word will proſper with me. And yet you ſee how 'tis, he hath ſufficiently plaid the part of a Devil with you, you were not ſo blind, or ſo dead, or ſo hard in your hearts many years ago, but you are every way as bad or worſe at this day; and becauſe you had not this fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, to diſcern that thus it might be, had you not the more reaſon to Fear it would be ſo?</p>
               <p>And what ſay you now as to the time to come? If it ſhould be ſaid unto you at this day, He that hath dealt thus by you hitherto, will be like enough to deal as bad or worſe by you, to the end of your dayes, ſo that you ſhall never be brought to Repentance, nor ever recover your ſelves out of the ſnares of the Devil; will you yet again ſay, I hope not, I fear it not? that very word is enough to make you tremble. If the God of this
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:103224:50"/>
World had not blinded your Minds, he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have thus hardned your Hearts.</p>
               <p>If you that have known Chriſt, and have been in Chriſt, many years ago; If ſome of you ſhould have been told, that if you look'd not the better to it, the Devil would meet you at the very threſhold of Chriſtianity, and hold you there from making any farther entrance in, would keep you Babes and Infants in the Grace of God, that he would keep you all this time, ſo weak in the Faith, ſo cold in your Love, ſo barren in your Life, that all this while you ſhould have gotten no more victory over this World, and the fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of your Minds and Hearts, nor no more intimate acquaintance with God and your own Souls than ſome of you have at this day; If when you had been told, you were in danger of being ſerv'd thus; If you had then anſwered, I do not Fear it, I ſhould have made bold to tell you, You do not know what a Devil he is with whom you had to do; and now that you may know him better, by obſerving how he hath dealt by you hitherto, you will at length, I hope, learn to Fear.</p>
               <p>What if the Devil ſhould now appear to you in ſome bodily monſtrous ſhape, would it not fright you? Why, you may ſee his foot, though you do not ſee his face; you may ſee him in what he hath done in his temptations of you, and the unhappy ſucceſs of them upon you, in that rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſtate your Souls are hereby in; and ſurely, Friends, to thoſe that underſtand him, The Devil in a ſecret temptation, is more formidable than the Devil in an Apparition; the prints of his
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:103224:51"/>
Hoofs, are a more dreadful ſight than the Horns of his Head.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Another reaſon why we ſhould Fear is, becauſe of the deceitfulneſs of our Hearts.</hi> What-ever our dangers are from without, what-ever deſigns or devices the Devil or the World have againſt us, yet if all were true within us, if our Hearts were true to us, our hazard were not ſo great; but, ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9. <hi>The Heart of Man is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful above all things.</hi> So that we may not only ſay with the Prophet, <hi>Micah</hi> 7.5. <hi>Truſt ye not in a Friend, put not confidence in a Guide;</hi> but with <hi>Solomon</hi> alſo, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.26. <hi>He that truſteth his own Heart is a Fool.</hi> The deceitfulneſs of the Heart ſtands;

               <p n="2">2. <hi>In its Subtilty.</hi> It is a crafty Heart, it hath many plots and devices to deceive; <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.21. <hi>There are many devices in Man's Heart.</hi> It hath much of the Devil in it; not only of the <hi>falſhood</hi> of the Devil, (as before); It is a lying Spirit; nor only of the <hi>uncleanneſs</hi> of the Devil, this alſo is the wicked one; nor of the <hi>malice</hi> of the Devil, It is the Enemy; but of the <hi>cunning</hi> of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, of the ſubtilty of the Serpent, This Serpent alſo is more ſubtile than all the Beaſts of the Field.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:103224:51"/>
It's true, it's alſo a ſilly Heart, eaſie to be beguiled; it is ſo ſubtil as to beguile, and yet ſo ſilly as eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be beguiled; like thoſe falſe Teachers, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Deceiving, and being deceived.</hi>

               <p>What are theſe hearts of ours often a-doing in ſecret, which no others, and it may be not our ſelves take notice of? When our eyes are cloſed, our hands are quiet, our tongues are ſilent, God knows what there may be doing within. There may be deviliſh devices contriving within, there may be dark counſels beneath; Heart may be Swearing, or Lying, or Stealing, or Coveting, or committing Adultery, whilſt there's no noiſe of any ſuch thing without. Yea, whilſt the Tongue is praying, the Ears are hearing, the Eye is lift up to Heaven, the Heart may be in Hell, or on Earth, in the Field, in the Shop, in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, or who knows where; but God's Eye is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
               <p>Friends, Who knows where our hearts are, or what they are a-doing at this hour? It may be, now God is a-preaching to you the Doctrine of Holy Fear, of Holy Watchfulneſs and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection; ſome of your hearts may be un-preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that God ſpeaks; may be preaching Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Licentiouſneſs, Slothfulneſs, Security to you, and telling you, there's no ſuch danger, and no ſuch need of Fear as hath been preached unto you.</p>
               <p>Or if they do not contradict the Word that the Lord hath ſpoken, yet it may be they divert you from minding it, by telling you ſome imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Stories about other things; filling your heads with your buſineſs or pleaſure, cutting you out your Work for to morrow. Look inward, Friends, ſee if you can find your Hearts within, or whether they be not gone abroad you know
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:103224:52"/>
not whither. But where-ever they are, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are doing, the Eye of the Lord is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; Men may diſſemble, and deal deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with God, but they cannot deceive him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>If they deceive Men, it is not ſo greatly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.</hi> Though that may be our wickedneſs too. If we hide our ſelves from others, if we be better, or if we be worſt than they apprehend us to be, there is not ſo much in that. The Heart is cunning at this alſo in deceiving of Men; by palliating evil intentions, with fair and ſpecious pretences; by ſeeking them out corners to ſin in, waiting for the twilight, or the darkneſs to be a covering for them; by ſmooth words and fair ſpeeches, beguiling the Hearts of the ſimple, by a kiſs of the Mouth, when there is war in the Heart, by putting the beſt ſide outward, putting on the clothing of a Sheep upon a Wolf or a Bear, the face of a Saint to cover the Soul of a Devil.</p>
               <p>What is the Hypocrites Praying, or Faſting, or Alms, or ſavoury Language and Diſcourſe? What is all this for? 'Tis but the Cloathing his Heart hath provided him, to advance and ſet him up in the opinion of others? 'tis to ſerve his pride or his covetouſneſs, and to hide the poverty and rottenneſs which is within, out of ſight. Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, are there none of us guilty upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count? Whoſe Religion, and the Exerciſe thereof, are a meer carnal Deſign, whoſe Duties are a meer Device to beguile Men into a good Opinion of us, to raiſe up or keep up our Reputation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them? Is it not thus with ſome of us?</p>
               <p>Soul, what haſt thou been doing to day? O, I have been Praying, and Hearing, and Faſting, or
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:103224:53"/>
keeping a Sabbath to the Lord. No, thou lyeſt, thou haſt been juggling, and cheating, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of Men. If theſe have been the Work of thy Tongue, or thine Ears, or thine Eyes, to pray, to hear, to praiſe the Lord; thine Heart hath found other work to do, it hath been making a Garment of theſe Prayers and Praiſes to dreſs up it ſelf in, thereby to commend and ſet it off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Spectators; or it may be, to hide or carry on ſome treacherous or wicked Deſign, which needed ſuch a covering.</p>
               <p>The Heart is thus buſie to deceive Men, but ſtill its greateſt and moſt miſchievous deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, lies here, in deceiving it ſelf. It is an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid wickedneſs to deal deceitfully with the Lord, to diſſemble and lye unto God. It is folly to be falſe to him who we know will diſcover the cheat and its higheſt impiety. What is Iniquity, if Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie be not? And what Hypocriſie like mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or lying unto God? It is Mens great ſin to deal deceitfully with Men; But that which I would now lay before you, as a ſpecial reaſon why we ſhould Fear our hearts, is their <hi>ſelf-deceivings;</hi> And how much Fear ſhould be upon us, upon this account, will appear when we have conſidered theſe three things.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Mens Hearts deceive them, about matters paſt, in their ſelf-reflections and reckonings.</hi> It may be ſometimes an eye may be caſt back upon what is paſt, and ſuch a word may be heard within, <hi>Soul, what haſt thou done?</hi> how haſt thou lived all thy time hitherto? what Evil haſt thou done, or what Good haſt thou done? The Heart preſently makes its return; and though it hath not the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, will make bold with the words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>I know nothing by myſelf,</hi> I know no hurt that I have done; or it may be, like thoſe unfaithful Officers, who bring in their preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Omnia bene,</hi> it will anſwer, I have done all things well, I have liv'd an harmleſs and an honeſt life. The little good that hath been done, looking on it by a falſe Glaſs, it ſees it double to what it is; every Mite is a Shekle, ever Shekle is a Talent; here it will be ſure to over-reckon: And all the Evils that have been done, for an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred or a thouſand, it takes the Bill and writes down ten, or it may be but one, and that a little one; and perhaps it buries them all in the land of forgetfulneſs. As Sin had <hi>an Act for Toleration</hi> before, ſo it muſt now have <hi>an Act of Oblivion.</hi> And by this hiding of Sin it comes to paſs, that Repentance alſo is hid from Mens eyes; <hi>No Man repented, nor ſaid, what have I done?</hi> Jer. 8.6. The not-ſaying what have I done, much more the ſaying, I have done nothing amiſs, will be a Bar
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:103224:54"/>
againſt Repentance; And that's the uſual iſſue of this falſhood of the Heart, about matters paſt, it holds under Impenitence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Mens Hearts deceive them about Matters pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or in their judgment of their preſent ſtates.</hi> What art thou? a Child of God, or a Child of the Devil? a Believer, or an Unbeliever? a ſound Believer, or an Hypocrite? Mens hearts will be civil with them, and give them good language; A Child of the Devil, a Reprobate? Theſe are hard words that will not be born, and ſhall not be uttered; whether it ſpeaks true or no, it will be ſure to ſpeak good to them. O, a Child of God no doubt, an honeſt, and therefore an happy Man. Though perhaps it neither knows what God is, or what a Child of God means, nor what the difference is betwixt the Children of God and the Children of the Devil.</p>
               <p>A faithful Heart will be (as I ſaid before) a ſelf-ſuſpecting Heart, and ſuch it ſhould be. The Word tells us, there's Chaff in the Floor as well as Wheat, there are Tares in the Field as well as good Corn. Now when the queſtion is put, which is the Chaff, who are the Tares? Mens Hearts ſhould anſwer, as the Diſciples did, when Chriſt told them there was a Traytor among them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.21. they all anſwered. <hi>Lord is it I? Lord is it I?</hi> Men and Brethren, there are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels among you, there are Hypocrites among you; If I ſhould ſpeak thus from the Lord to this Congregation, this Queſtion ſhould run even through the whole Company; Lord is it I? am not I an Hypocrite? am not I one of theſe Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers? But what do your Hearts ſay to you? O, I thank God it is not I, I am none of them; Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:103224:54"/>
there are, but my Soul is upright. If a whole Congregation ſhould be thus ſpoken to one by one, may be ſome of the beſt among them, that had leaſt reaſon to ſuſpect themſelves, would cry out, Lord, is it I? I doubt I may be an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, I fear how it may be with me; but for the moſt, and poſſibly the very worſt among them, they would never ſtick to anſwer, I am none of them, I thank God I have an honeſt Heart, and am upright before God. Whence comes this now to paſs? Why, that Heart of thine hath plaid the Devil with thee, and deceived thee.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>About Matters to come.</hi> If the caſe be ſo plain, that the naughtineſs of the Life paſt, and the unſoundneſs of the preſent ſtate cannot be hid, then the Heart promiſes better things <hi>de fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turo.</hi> I'le look better to it hereafter, though I cannot at preſent, yet after a while I mean to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a new Man; ſtay but a while, and I will be ſober; ſtay but a while, and I mean to have done with this vain or worldly Life, and to live in all things as becometh a Chriſtian. Thus it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and its Promiſes muſt be taken. If I turn at laſt, 'twill be well enough, and turn I will ſhortly, I mean no other; and this muſt ſatisfie and be inſtead of preſent Repentance. How much credit there is to be given to ſuch a Promiſe, the experience of many ſufficiently tells. But though it hath been a known Deceiver, yet ſtill it's truſted.</p>
               <p>You that profeſs Religion, that own Chriſt, and hold Communion with his Saints, and are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly walking in the way of Righteouſneſs; If you ſhould be ask'd, How long wilt thou hold this courſe, wilt thou hold out to the end? To
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:103224:55"/>
day thou art with Chriſt, but where wilt thou be tomorrow? Now with the Diſciples, but wilt thou never go over to the Scribes and Phariſees? Thou mayeſt feel the ſmart of Chriſtianity, thou mayeſt become a Reproach and made a Prey. The Shepherds may be ſmitten, and the Flocks may be ſcattered; wilt thou not then forſake Chriſt, and run over to the Tents of the Uncircumciſed? God forbid, ſayes the heart preſently; Turn from the Holy Commandment, deny Chriſt? <hi>No, though I die with him, I will never deny him.</hi> I, but there was one ſpake as much before you, 'twas the word of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Heart, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.35. And yet you know what follow'd; Conſider him, and fear how it may be with you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>By what will our Hearts deceive us?</hi> By any thing in the World; there's nothing comes a-miſs to them, but ſome evil uſe or other they can make of it, either to intice to Sin, or to harden againſt Repentance, or to lay a-ſleep in Security, or to build us up in Preſumption. The Heart is ſuch an Adverſary, that can fight at any Weapon; ſuch a Mountebank, that can make its Compoſition of any Ingredients, that can make a Poiſon of any Medicine, ſome way or other it can make uſe of any thing, to ſerve it in its deceiving work.</p>
               <p>By what did <hi>Eve</hi>'s Heart deceive her? By an Apple. By what did <hi>Achan</hi>'s Heart deceive him? By a Wedg of Gold.. By what did <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Heart deceive him? By a Whore. By what was <hi>Eſau</hi> deceived? By a Meſs of Pottage. By what do poor Mens Hearts deceive them? By their Want and Penury. By what do rich Mens Hearts deceive them? By their Abundance and Variety. By what do evil Mens Hearts deceive them? By
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:103224:55"/>
their Luſts they are drawn aſide and inticed. By what do good Mens Hearts deceive them? Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times even by the Good that is in them. The Heart of Man can make a Snare of every Creature, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, Relation, or Comfort, can make a Net for Souls of the courſeſt or of the fineſt Thred; can undo them, by their Friends and by their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, by their Proſperities and by their Adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, by their Sins and their Rigthouſneſs. Where-withal may this Man be enticed to Sin, to neglect Chriſt and his Soul? Some Mens Hearts find that a Harlot will do it; others, that a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Companion will do it; others, that nothing but Gold and Silver will do it; others, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe will do it; ſome that Idleneſs, others that Buſineſs, ſome that Friends, others that Enemies; ſome that Proſperity, others that Affliction, will be the likelieſt Temptations; and accordingly it manages its deceiving work.</p>
               <p>Our Hearts can deceive us <hi>by the beſt we have,</hi> by our Vertues, by our Duties, by our Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges; and this is often the moſt dangerous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit. The more generous the Wine in which thou receiveſt thy Poiſon, the more deadly the Potion.</p>
               <p>Some Hypocrites Hearts tell them they are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere; But how can they make them believe it? Why, if the Heart may not be believed for its own word, the Word of God muſt be brought to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs this lye. Doth not the Scriptures ſay, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9. <hi>If thou confeſs with thy Mouth the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and believe in thy Heart that God raiſed him from the Dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved?</hi> And do not I believe the Reſurrection of Chriſt from the Dead? Do not I confeſs and acknowledg it? I be ieve it with all mine Heart, I confeſs it before
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:103224:56"/>
all the World; and therefore without doubt I am in a ſtate of Salvation.</p>
               <p>If this will not do, but the Heart perceives there muſt be more in that belief than a notional Aſſent, there muſt be more in that Confeſſion than a verbal Acknowledgment, than its Virtues, and Duties, and Priviledges; its Prayers, and Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and Alms; its Sobriety and Temperance; its keeping of Sabbaths, and attending upon Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, muſt all be call'd forth to teſtifie: Am not I of God? Am not I in Chriſt? Let my Prayers ſpeak, let mine Alms ſpeak, let my Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, let my Patience, let my Sabbaths ſpeak whoſe I am. I keep the Sabbath, whilſt others pollute it; I hear, whilſt others forbear; I pray and faſt, whilſt others neglect both, and therefore ſure it muſt be well with me; when yet it may be, the Man is ignorant of the Spirit, and a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Enemy againſt the Power and Purity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion all the while.</p>
               <p>I might multiply Inſtances of the ſeveral ſorts of the Heart's deceivings, and ſhew that there is nothing, but in ſome way or other, may be made uſe of to beguile us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Of what may our Hearts deceive us?</hi> Even of all we have. Of what did our firſt Parents Hearts deceive them? Of their Portion in God, and their place in Paradiſe. Of what did <hi>Eſau</hi>'s Heart deceive him? Of his Birth-right and the Bleſſing. Of what did <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Heart deceive him? Of his Locks and of his Life. Of what did that Fool's Heart deceive him? <hi>Luke</hi> 12.20. Of his Soul. Iſa. 44.20. <hi>A deceived Heart hath turned him aſide, ſo that he cannot deliver his Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:103224:56"/>You that believe your ſelves Saints, are apt to think, that what-ever you be deceived of, yet your Souls are ſafe, and therefore that you have no ſuch need to Fear as other Men. But it may be you may be deceived in this, and this very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, That thy Soul is ſafe, may prove its eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal loſs. But if you ſhould come off at laſt, with the Salvation of your Souls, yet how many deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate hazards do you run of loſing them, by heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to theſe evil Hearts? How much of your time do they ſteal away, which was given you for the working out your Salvation? How many Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have they loſt you? how many Ordinances have they loſt you, which the Intereſt of your Souls could ill have ſpar'd? What a dead, and dark, and carnal, and looſe Spirit haſt thou ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times been bewitched into, wherein God hath been laid by, Soul hath been forgotten, Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath been laid a-ſleep, and all care about the things of God, hath been ſwallowed up of the cares of this Life? Is it nothing to thee to be in ſuch a caſe? Doth it not grieve thee to think whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou art fallen? and art thou not afraid what the iſſue may be? whether ever thy Soul may be lifted up out of this Pit, whereinto it is ſunk ſo deep in mud and mire? But if thou ſhould'ſt be ask'd now, Friend, how cameſt thou in hither? who hath led thee into this Dirt? who hath caſt thee into this Pit? May be thou wilt be ready to anſwer as <hi>Eve</hi> did, The Serpent beguiled me in; or as <hi>Adam</hi> did, The Woman deceived me in; thou wilt find ſome elſe to father thy Faults upon; the Devil deceived me into this caſe, the World deceived me in, evil Company deceived me in; Like enough they did, But what could they all
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:103224:57"/>
have done, if thine Heart had not joyned with them? <hi>The hand of</hi> Joab <hi>is in all this;</hi> thine Heart is the <hi>Joab,</hi> that hath dealt this ſubtilly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully with thee.</p>
               <p>1 Kings 22.20. <hi>Who will perſwade</hi> Ahab (ſaith the Lord <hi>that be may go up and fall at</hi> Ramoth Gilead?

If it ſhall be ſaid in like manner, who ſhall perſwade this fooliſh Man to go on his evil wayes, that he may fall and periſh? I will go, ſayes his Heart, preſently, I'le be the Devil to perſwade him; But wherewith wilt thou perſwade him? O, I'le be a lying Spirit within him.

               <p>Chriſtians, we have every one of us ſuch an Heart as this, that is too ready to go upon ſuch a wretched Errand. Have we not ſuffered much by it's treachery? Hath it not often trip'd up our heels, or turned us out of our way? Hath it not betray'd us out of our Refuge, and led us aſide af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter lying vanities? Though Grace hath been ſome
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:103224:57"/>
ſecurity to us againſt it, yet hath it not often been too hard for all the Grace we have? Who is there of us that dares ſtand forth and ſay, My Heart, I hope, is no ſuch heart; It is better than to deal thus with me; I dare truſt it, it is a plain and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt heart, there's no deceit or guile found in it? Is there ever a one of you that dare ſay thus? What complaints are there every-where heard againſt it, even amongſt the beſt of Chriſtians?] But O what do Sinners hearts deceive them of? What a price is there in Sinners hands, if they had an heart to it? There's the Bleſſed Goſpel before them, exhibiting Chriſt, and Pardon, and Life to them; they have the Scriptures before them; they have Sabbaths and Ordinances amongſt them; but behold, they can make nothing of them. The Goſpel is opened, and yet it is hid from them; Chriſt is preached, but 'tis not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by them; they can live ander the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word, be converſant at Prayers, Faſts, Sacraments, a whole Age together, and get no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by them; they can dwell by the Wells of Salvation, and get not one drop of Water; live by the richeſt Mines, and get not a duſt of Silver; walk in the Sun-beams, and ſee never a gleam of Light; come into the Store-houſes, and yet ſtarve for want of Bread; can get neither Grace nor Knowledg, but remain blind and dead, under all that Light that hath ſhined unto them.</p>
               <p>But how is it, Sinner, that it's thus with thee? Whom haſt thou to blame but thine own Heart? This hath been telling thee, either that thou haſt no need of Chriſt, or his Grace, or that thou haſt time enough before thee; or elſe hath diverted thee from giving heed to the Word of Life, by
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:103224:58"/>
finding thee ſo much other work to do; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thou ſeeſt how it hath left thee; It hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto loſt thee a Chriſt, loſt thee a Goſpel, loſt thee Sabbaths and Ordinances, and is juſt loſing thee thy Soul. This Heart is it that would not ſuffer thee, when thou haſt been commanded to accept of Chriſt, or deliver thy ſelf up to him. Any elſe that comes to demand it, thy Soul is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently delivered up. Let Luſt come and require, Deliver up thy Soul to me; Let thy Companions come and demand, Deliver up thy ſelf to us; Let the World, or let the Devil demand, Deliver up thy Soul to me; let me have the rule and the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of it, and up thou reſigneſt it preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; any but Chriſt may have thee for asking.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Will the Men of</hi> Keilah <hi>deliver me up?</hi> ſaid <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> once, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.11. Will they Lord? or may I truſt my ſelf with them? Truſt them not, ſayes God, they will deliver thee up. Doſt thou ask, will mine Heart deliver me up? deliver me up to Luſt, or to the World, or the ſnares of the Devil, or may I truſt it? Truſt it not, it will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver thee up. But to Chriſt it will not deliver thee up.</p>
               <p>It will be telling thee, that Chriſt is an <hi>auſtere Man,</hi> and thou ſhalt find him an hard Maſter; 'twill ſhew thee the Yoke and the Croſs; How ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere is his Government? how ſhort his Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance? how hard will be the uſage thou muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of him, or for his ſake? And thereupon it will ſuggeſt, how much it doth befriend thee, in refuſing to deliver thee up to him. It will never tell thee of thy need of Chriſt, of the gain that will come in by him; thou muſt not be ſuffered ſo much as to think of that; if thou turn aſide at
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:103224:58"/>
any time to commune with him, or to look with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Vail where his Treaſures lie, it calls thee off preſently, or throws in the World, its Cares or its pleaſures upon thee, to thruſt out and turn thee aſide from all ſuch thoughts, leſt he ſhould gain thy conſent and good liking. Thus thine Heart hath ſerv'd thee all thy dayes, ſo that hitherto thou wilt none of Chriſt; and thus 'tis like to ſerve thee to the end of thy dayes, till there be no Chriſt, nor Mercy, nor Salvation to be had for ever.</p>
               <p>And thus have I given you a ſhort hint of the deceitfulneſs of the Heart; and is not ſuch an Heart to be feared? Is ſuch an Heart to be truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? an Heart that will deceive you, about every thing that you are concern'd to mind; about matters paſt, preſent, and to come; that will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let you conſider what you have done, nor know what you are, nor think whats like to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of you herafter? that will deceive you, by every thing you have to do withal; that can make every Relation, every Companion, every Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, every Comfort, every Croſs, every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a Gin and a Trap to take your Souls? that will deceive you of all that ever you have; that like thoſe Locuſts and Caterpillars (the Plagues of <hi>Egypt</hi>) will not leave any green thing in you? that will deceive you of your ſelves, of your lives; of that Chriſt, of that Goſpel, which is all you have for Eternity; that will lie at you every day, every hour, as <hi>Delilah</hi> at <hi>Sampſon,</hi> to betray you into the hands of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> and caſt you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the eternal Priſon? Have you ſuch an Heart? have every one of you ſuch an Heart? have you prov'd by ſo long experience, what miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:103224:59"/>
it hath done you already, and yet not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid?</p>
               <p>O Chriſtians, let us get more acquaintance with theſe Hearts of ours; if we do not fear them, 'tis becauſe we know them no better. Let us ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them daily at their work, what colours and fair pretences they have to palliate and lead unto Sin, what ſhifts and excuſes they make for the neglect of Duty; what delayes and puttings off, from the minding our neceſſary and moſt weighty concerns; and what wiles and devices they have to lull us and hold us faſt aſleep, whilſt our oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of obtaining Mercy, ſteal by us and are loſt. Know this Heart of thine more thorowly, and then tell me if thou doſt not fear it?</p>
               <p>If there be an <hi>Abſalom</hi> in the Court, a <hi>Sheba</hi> in the City, a <hi>Judas</hi> in the Company, a Thief in the Houſe, is there not cauſe of fear? Thou haſt a <hi>Judas</hi> in thy Breaſt, a Thief in thy Boſom, thou haſt not an Heart within thee, if thou haſt not a mortal Enemy that ſeeks thy life.</p>
               <p>As I ſaid before, ſo I ſay again, Study and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve your Hearts more; believe the Truth of what hath been ſaid; or if you will not believe your Ears, believe your own Eyes, believe your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences and Obſervations, (if you have been ſo wiſe as to make any Obſervations upon your ſelves). Indeed that's the reaſon why we are ſo hard to believe, our Hearts are ſo bad, becauſe we have no more obſerved them: Have you obſerved, have you conſidered how they have dealt with you? Who is it that hath kept you back from Chriſt, and ſhort of the Grace of God? or at leaſt, Who is it that hath kept you ſo low and ſo barren, and ſuch aa ill Steward of that Grace
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:103224:59"/>
which you have received, has not thine own Heart had the great hand in it? Be not deceived, it is the ſame Heart ſtill, and is like to take the ſame courſe.</p>
               <p>That which hath hindred, doth hinder thee; that which hath deceived, doth deceive, and will deceive; thou canſt never be ſecure from it whilſt thou continueſt in this World. Wherefore, O my Soul, ſince I cannot be out of danger, let me ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be out of fear. Let Fools be ſecure and at reſt, but as for me. Let me paſs the time of my Sojouring here in Fear.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Another reaſon why we ſhould Fear, is, becauſe of the weight and importance of that work which we have to do in the World.</hi> What is our Work here? wherefore are we born, and live upon this Earth? 'Tis to <hi>ſerve the Lord in the ſaving of our Souls.</hi> The Lord that made us, may and does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire our whole Service; as there is none beſides him to whom we owe our Being, ſo is there none other to whom we owe our Service. <hi>Him only ſhalt thou ſerve,</hi> Mat. 4.10. And God hath ſo ordered the matter, that we cannot better ſerve our ſelves, than by ſerving of him; this is the Work of God, which he requires of us, <hi>to work out our own Salvation.</hi> Phil. 2.12. The beſt Men are the greateſt ſelf-ſeekers. 'Tis a piece of ſelf-denyal, which God never requires of any Man, To neglect his own Soul. God <hi>would have all Men to be ſaved,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.4.</p>
               <p>There are two Lords that are ſerved in the World; God and the Devil. The great Service that the Devil hath to be done, is to deſtroy Souls; his Name is <hi>the Deſtroyer,</hi> Rev. 9.11. and his work is to deſtroy; and this is it which he impoſes upon
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:103224:60"/>
all his Servants, to deſtroy every Man his own Soul. God is <hi>the Saviour,</hi> ſo call'd, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.15. and his whole work that he has to be done by his, is Salvation-work.</p>
               <p>Friends, the firſt and great Service that God hath for every one of you to do, is to look well to thoſe Souls of yours, to recover your ſelves out of the Snares of the Devil, that you may obtain everlaſting Salvation; if you can but acquit your ſelves ſo in this World, that you get ſafe to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when you die, God will ſay to you, <hi>Well done, good and faithful Servant.</hi> 'Tis true, we have every one of us more Souls than our own to look too; I not only Miniſters (whoſe ſpecial work it is) but every one ſhould do what he can to ſave the Souls of others; but our firſt Service is to look to our own Souls. Our Charity, and ſo our whole care, muſt begin at home. Deut. 4.9. <hi>Take heed to [thy ſelf] and keep thy Soul,</hi> [thine own Soul] <hi>diligently.</hi> As Chriſt ſayes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.12. <hi>He that will not be faithful in that which is anothers, who ſhall truſt him with that which is his own?</hi> May we not much more ſay here, he that is not faithful in that which is his own, will be much leſs faithtul in that which is anothers. He that ſerves the Devil in deſtroying his own Soul, is not like to ſerve God in the ſaving of others Souls.</p>
               <p>Well, this is your work you have to do in the World, To ſerve the Lord; And this is the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that God expects, That you ſave your own Souls. What-ever you are faithfully doing this way, you are therein ſerving God. You may be ſaving your Eſtates, and therein ſerve the Devil;
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:103224:60"/>
you may ſave your Names, and ſave your Lives, and therein ſerve the Devil; but when you are ſaving your Souls, you are ſtill ſerving the Lord. The working out of our Salvation, is not only the buſineſs of our Religious Duties, but of all the Actions of our whole courſe. We are not only to Believe, and Repent, and Hear, and Faſt, and Pray for our Lives, but to be carrying on our Salvation-Work in every thing we do. As we may ſay, whether you Believe, or Repent, or Pray, or Hear; ſo alſo, whether you Eat, or Drink, or whatſoever elſe you do, do all to the Glory of God, and your own Salvation. Our future ſtate, whether we are for Life or for Death, is not to be determined by ſome few of our better Deeds, but by the tenour of our whole courſe; look what thy Life is in this World, ſo ſhall thy Judgment be.</p>
               <p>We are here in this World, upon our good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour for the other World; and the ſhort time we have here, is all we have for Eternity; our Everlaſting Life or Death, will be determined by this little inch of time. Do in your day the Work you were ſent into the World for, and you live and are bleſſed for ever; ſpend your time in idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or impertinencies, live in the neglect of God or your Souls, let your great Work be left undone, or but half-done, and done deceitfully, and you die without remedy, die eternally.</p>
               <p>And do you not yet ſee what cauſe you have to Fear? If you were doing any thing of this World's Buſineſs, and knew your Life lay upon it, 'twould make your hand ſhake. Pſal. 2.11. <hi>Serve the Lord with Fear.</hi> Phil. 2.12 <hi>Work out your Salvation with fear and trembling.</hi> Why
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:103224:61"/>
ſhould we Fear? why ſhould we Trembie? Why, becauſe there is ſo great a Work lying upon our hands. What if this Work be done, and well done? Then you are made for ever. What if you neglect or miſcarry in this Work? Then you are loſt irrecoverably. 'Tis a matter of Life and Death that you are every day and hour upon; how can you think ſuch a thought without a trembling Heart?</p>
               <p>What a mighty influence would this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have <hi>upon your Duties?</hi> When you go to Pray, whether in the Cloſet, or in the Family, or in the Congregation, were you perſwaded that your eternal ſtate were ſo much concern'd in it, would you not fear how you trifled in ſo great a Duty? and would not this Fear command in all your Powers, to joyn in ſo important a Service? how would it ſtand at the door, and keep out all thoſe ſtragling thoughts, that at ſuch times uſe to be thruſting in? Would ſuch haſty and curſory Praying, ſuch a flat and formal Devotion, which you ordinarily take up with then ſuffice you? you would ſooner ſweat than ſleep at Prayer, your Hearts would burn within you, and not freeze, as they too often do; Tongue-Prayers, and Knee-Prayers, and Eye-Prayers, would be of as little account with you, as they are with God; all the Males in your Flock would be brought in, you would not dare to offer to the Lord a corrupt thing. You would take your beſt time, and time enough, you would put forth the utmoſt of your ſtrength, you would not make your Souls to wait the leiſure of your Fleſh, or to take its leavings. It muſt not then be what you can ſpare from the World, what you can ſpare from
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:103224:61"/>
your buſineſs or your pleaſures that will do the turn; your eating time, your ſleeping time, your working time, muſt be taken up this way, rather than want time for God and your Souls. Doſt thou complain of ſleepineſs in Prayer, of wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings in Prayer, of want of time for Prayer? Think, Man, what Prayer is for; how much there is depending on the faithful diſcharge of it; and ſee if this doth not work ſuch a Fear upon thine Heart, as will both find thee time, and keep thee waking.</p>
               <p>When you go to hear the Word, if you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, I am now hearing for my Life, the Lord God hath brought me before him, that he may tell me words whereby I may be ſaved; the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven are now open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me; the moſt High comes down to ſhew me the Path of Life; that Word that falls from the Preacher's Lips, is the Word by which I muſt be ſaved, and the Word by which I muſt be judged; 'tis the Everlaſting Goſpel I come now to hear, which is all I have for Eternity; I muſt ſtand or fall, live or die, according to the ſucceſs of this Word upon me. As this is the only Word of Life, ſo this may be the only time of Life; God knows whether this may not be the laſt Warning, the laſt Inſtruction, the laſt Tender of Grace and Mercy that I may have for ever; whether my hearkning to, or letting ſlip what I ſhall hear from the Lord this day, be not that which muſt give the final determination of mine Everlaſting State. What would ſuch thoughts, (did they ſit cloſe upon our Hearts, when we come to hear the Word) what would ſuch thoughts work? would they not command
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:103224:62"/>
thee, take heed how thou heareſt, give heed to the things thou heareſt, fear how thou let them ſlip? Would a deaf Ear, a wandring Eye, a roving I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination be then endured by thee? Wouldſt thou then ſuffer, as ordinarily thou doſt, thoſe wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Birds to catch up the incorruptible Seed as it falls upon thee? would it not ſend thee home with a trembling Heart, at all ſuch times when thou haſt left all thou heardſt behind thee?</p>
               <p>Conſider, Friends, where are you at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent? what makes you here this day? Let me rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with you a little before the Lord; How is it that all your Spirits are not ſtanding upon the Watch-Tower, whilſt the King of Glory paſſeth by? How is it that all your Ears, and Eyes, and Hearts, are not waiting for him? why ſit you here all the day idle? Do you not underſtand what Work 'tis you are upon? O take heed to your ſelves, Salvation and Damnation are before you, and one of the two you are certainly work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out. Is it indifferent to you which of the two it be? is it all one to pleaſe God or to provoke him? to get you nearer, or to put you farther off from the Kingdom of God? What think you of ſuch praying, and ſuch hearing as you content your ſelves with? Will the living God be ſerv'd with ſuch ſpiritleſs Duties? Is Death your way to Life? Are theſe dead and heartleſs Duties? Is this dead praying, and dull hearing, that upon which you will venture your Souls? Will you pray your ſelves into Hell? While you have in your hands the Key of the Kingdom of Heaven, will you lock the Door with it, and ſhut your ſelves out? Whilſt others are ſwearing, and lying, and coveting, and curſing themſelves to Hell, will
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:103224:62"/>
you be hearing and praying your ſelves thither? whither elſe will ſuch dead Duties carry you? cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſuch bleſſing is as curſing, ſuch hearing is as hardning the Ears, ſuch praying is as bleſſing an Idol. Will God regard Mockers? Will God be ſerved with Wind and Words? O tremble! fear leſt you not only loſe all your Duties, but be irrecoverably loſt by them.</p>
               <p>Again, what an influence would this Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration have upon <hi>all the actions of your Life,</hi> if you underſtood and were ſenſible that all that ever you do, hath ſuch a reſpect to your eternal ſtate, that according to it, your final Sentence will be. Where-ever you are, what-ever you are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you are ſerving God or the Devil, you are working for Life or for Death. There are no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different actions (conſidered, <hi>in individuo,</hi> and with their Circumſtances) that make neither one way or other, all our motions are either upward or downward.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our Life is our Race,</hi> and every Action of our Lives is a ſtep backward or forward, our going in or out of our way. Nay, onr very doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is doing ſomething; if our eaſe or reſt be idleneſs, it's ſerving the Devil; if it be a refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for our Work, it's ſerving God. We may be in a ſenſe ſerving God when we be a-ſleep, and we may alſo by our ſleep be ſerving the Fleſh and the Devil. We are ever either laying aſide our Weights, or laying on more Weight; we are making us <hi>Wings,</hi> or making us <hi>Chains;</hi> helping our ſelves on, or hindering us in our way. We are in this World as <hi>Merchants</hi> trading for Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Our whole Life is a treaſuring up good or evil for our ſelves againſt the laſt day. We are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:103224:63"/>
either buying or ſelling, buying the Truth of ſelling our Souls; we are upon the Exchange every day, and hour, either changing better for worſe, or worſe for better; every inch of our time, is our Talent to trade withal, and we are ſtill laying it out to our gain or our loſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our Lives are our Seed-time;</hi> we are ſtill ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Harveſt; what we ſow in Time, we muſt reap in Eternity. Our Eating and Drinking, our Working and Playing, our Talking and our Silence, will one way or other ſpring up to our hands hereafter.</p>
               <p>Do you underſtand this, Friends? Do you conſider it? O what manner of Perſons ſhould we then be, what wary and circumſpect Lives ſhould we live? Would not this, if it were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, dam up that ſtream of Iniquity that runs down through all our courſe? Would our covetous practices, our fraudulent and unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dealings; would that lying and ſcoffing, that ſelf ſeeking and fleſh-pleaſing, which take up ſo much of our time; would this hold up the head againſt ſuch a ſenſe of the influence they muſt have upon our eternal State? Should we then ſpend ſo much of our time in doing wickedly, or doing nothing? would it not find us other Work, and work enough for our Time, our Tongues, and our Hands, and our Heads, and all our Powers? But we do not conſider or underſtand.</p>
               <p>When you are walking in the vanity of your Minds, after the Luſts of this World; what do you uſe to think of this? or do you think no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it? I, ſo 'tis indeed, you will not then think what you are doing, but ſtand and pauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while; when you are ſerving your fleſh, can you
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:103224:63"/>
think now I am ſerving the Lord, now I am working out my Salvation, now I am providing for my Soul, and laying up againſt the time to come? Dare you ſay, now I am ſowing for Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, this is that which I would reap in the other World? This Mirth and this Jollity, this Pride and this Idleneſs, this Laughter and theſe Lyes; Let theſe and the Crop they will bring forth, be my Harveſt hereafter? Would not the thoughts of ſuch a Harveſt, make you dread ſuch a Seed-time.</p>
               <p>Or elſe can you ſay, The time that I ſpend thus I can ſpare from my Soul, that care's taken al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, Chriſt is ſure, Heaven is ſure to me; Now for the fleſh, and mine eaſe, and my pleaſure now for this preſent World, I have done enough for that to come? Or elſe will you ſay, Theſe dayes of my Vanity and Earthlineſs, will, I hope, be left out of my Reckoning; my Prayers and my Alms, the good that I have done is ſo much, that my evil Deeds and Dayes will be over look'd and paſt by?</p>
               <p>But muſt not every Day, muſt not every Work be brought to Judgment? Doth not the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and All-ſeeing God book down all? Is not the Sin of <hi>Judah</hi> written, as well as their Tears and Duties? Is not every thing noted in his Book? And muſt not all things that are written therein, be read in that day? Canſt thou look on this, and not fear continually every day? 1 Pet. 1.17. <hi>If ye call on the Father, who without reſpect of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, judgeth according to every Man's Work, paſs the time of your ſojourning here in Fear.</hi> If you had to do with a God that would never call you to a Reckoning, whether you ſerv'd him or not,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:103224:64"/>
or how much or how little you ſerv'd him, or whom elſe you ſerv'd beſides him; if you had to do only with ſuch a God, the matter were not then ſo much how you liv'd and ſpent your time: But if ye call on the Father, if you ſerve ſuch a God, who will reckon with every one of you, and for every thing you have done, you had need look better to it; Paſs the time, the whole time, of your Sojourning here in Fear.</p>
               <p>Beloved, if your own Souls were not ſo highly concern'd, yet this Conſideration, That the Work of your Lives is, <hi>to ſerve the Lord,</hi> would work you to Fear.</p>
               <p>If you were upon ſome Service for a Prince, or a great Man of the Earth, ſuppoſe it were but to make him a Garment, would you not fear how you ſullied it, or bungled upon it? Or if it were but to keep his Garden, would you not fear how you let it run to ruine? What is this God whom you ſerve? Is he not a great God, the King of all the Earth? Is he not an Holy God, and a Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous God, that looks to be ſanctified, and to be the Fear and the Dread of all thoſe that ſerve him? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.23. The Service of God is often expreſt in Scripture, by fearing of God. Cornelius, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.2. was ſaid to be a Man <hi>fearing God;</hi> that is, the ſame as a Man that ſerved the Lord: And the Apoſtle exhorts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28. That we <hi>have Grace in our Hearts, whereby we may ſerve God accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, with reverence and Godly Fear.</hi> Thou ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt the Lord, but wouldſt thou that thy Service be accepted with God? Then ſerve him with Fear.</p>
               <p>Therefore, to the end to hold this Fear upon you, I ſhall add this Counſel.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:103224:64"/>
                  <hi>Through your whole courſe, and all the parts of it, carry this expreſs Notion upon your Hearts, That you are ſerving the Lord in all that you do.</hi> Do all you do as the Servants of the Lord, and look on every Duty as the ſerving of him. What the Apoſtle requires of the Servants of Men, is the Duty of every one of the Servants of God; <hi>Col.</hi> 3.23, 24. <hi>What-ever you do, do it heartily [as] un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, for ye ſerve the Lord Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When you go to pray, think with your ſelves, this is a Duty which I ow to God. I am going into my Cloſet, upon a Service I have to do for God there: When you give an Alms, or when you teach or inſtruct your Families, think with your ſelves, theſe are Services which I have to perform, not only to my poor Brethren, to my ignorant Family, but I ow them to the Lord, and to him I will perform them; I have a Service to do for God amongſt the Poor, I have a Service to do for God in my Family; God hath bid me Feed the one and Teach the other, and to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I do it, I'le do it as unto the Lord.</p>
               <p>And in like manner, in all the matters of your Life, in the ordering of your whole Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, let this be ſtill in your Eye, and upon your Heart, God hath ſent me forth as his Servant into the World; I have no buſineſs here but for the moſt High; I am born for him, I am fed, I am clothed, I live for him; all that ever I have are the Talents of my Lotd, committed to me to uſe and improve for him. I am Debtor to no other, I am Servant to none elſe; what-ever goes out any other way, this is no leſs than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs to him, whoſe I am; and now I go bound for him; for his pleaſure I was made, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:103224:65"/>
to him I am devoted; this Life of mine, and every day of it, and every breath of it, I conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate to the Lord; his Servant I am, and 'tis no Work for me, that I cannot call ſerving the Lord.</p>
               <p>What would ſuch a Sentiment upon the Heart bring forth? What care, yea, what watchfulneſs, yea, what fear would it produce? What, ſhall I ſerve the Lord with that which coſt me nothing? Shall cheap-Service, and eaſie-Service, and lazy-Service, and eye-Service, be all that the Lord God ſhall have of me? I dare not ſerve my Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour ſo, and how will my God take it? But what, ſhall I divide my Service betwixt the Lord and any other Maſter? ſhall my Fleſh be ſerv'd, ſhall my Pride be ſerv'd, ſhall my Covetouſneſs, ſhall Men be ſerv'd? ſhall this Heart, or this Time, or this Eſtate be divided betwixt the Lord and them? How if the Lord find me in another Field, in another Houſe, or upon other Work, than whither he ſent and appointed me? How if he find any of his Talents waſted, his Goods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed away to another Maſter? how will he bear it? Yea, how ſhall I bear it? Art thou not afraid, O my Soul, how this will be born, and what a Reckoning thou mayeſt be brought to for it? O, let me fear to be ſuch an evil Servant, that I may not fear the evil Servant's doom; let me continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally fear, every day, that I may prevent the fear of the Reckoning-Day. Such a ſtanding Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, would this Notion of our being engaged in Service for God, kept conſtantly upon the Heart, produce.</p>
               <p>This Notion, mingled with all our Thoughts, Duties, and Wayes, and the Holy Fear it will
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:103224:65"/>
bring forth, will not only hold us to conſtant Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but will put us upon the higheſt and beſt Service. What is the Lord whom I ſerve? Is he not one who looks for all I have, and is he not worthy of all I have? What an honour is it to be the Servant of God, and what a terror to be none of that number? He is the beſt Maſter, he is worthy, he is worthy of the very beſt I have. Fear, and be aſhamed, O my Soul, to put him off with any thing that is not worthy of him. What will an ingenious Spirit fear, more than to be baſe and unworthy.</p>
               <p>Should you ask ſuch a Perſon, Why are you ſo exact, and ſo tender, and ſo circumſpect in your way? Why are you ſo buſie, and ſo ſtudious, and ſo laborious in your courſe? Why can you not, as well as others, take up with a lower and more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs way of Religion? O, I dare not be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy; I am the Servant of God, and through his Grace, I will ſerve him the beſt I can. He that is moſt Holy, and moſt Circumſpect, that keeps the cloſeſt to his Work and his Rule, he is the beſt Servant to God; and as I am obliged, ſo I am reſolved, through the help of God, to do him the moſt Honour, and the beſt Service I can. I ſhould be a Wretch, a vile and unworthy Perſon, if I were otherwiſe minded.</p>
               <p>The great God hath but few Servants in the World; hath he taken me into the number of thoſe few? O, what ſhall I render? how can I be ſufficiently thankful for that Grace? God hath but few Servants in the World, and the fewer the more ſerviceable have they need to be. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil hath many Servants, he hath thoſe that ſerve him in every Houſe, in every Town, there are
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:103224:66"/>
whole Countries that are wholly peopled with the Servants of the Devil; and their Work is, to do all the diſ-ſervice and diſhonour they can to God; to cheriſh the Fleſh, and foment the Luſts thereof, to fill the World with wickedneſs, and to trample upon all that's left of God in it. What multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes hath the Devil that ſerve him every-where, and how buſie are they at their Work? God hath but a few Servants, and ſince he hath made me one of them, I'le do him the beſt Service I can. Such a bleſſed and quickning influence, would ſuch abiding thoughts have upon all the People of God.</p>
               <p>As 'twould be on the contrary, If Sinners would carry this thought upon their Hearts, I am every day <hi>ſerving the Devil,</hi> it would be a Bridle to hold them in; ſo if People kept up ſuch a thought, I am ſerving the Lord, 'twould be a Spur to quicken them on. Such a thought upon Sinners Hearts, I am ſerving the Devil, would ſtrike ſuch a fear, as would drive them quite backwards. The very ſame fear, which would animate Saints, would ſtrike Sinners dead in the Neſt.</p>
               <p>If a Sinner that's going to the Ale-houſe, would ſeriouſly conſider, and ask himſelf, Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther am I going, and upon whoſe Errand? And his Heart ſhould anſwer, I am going to the Ale-houſe to ſerve the Devil; the Devil hath ſome Servants at work there for him, at their Drinking-work, Swearing-work, Scoffing-work, and I am going among them to help on the Devil's Work: And if others that are ſerving their Covetouſneſs, or their Pride, or their Envy, if their Hearts ſhould tell them, This alſo is ſerving the Devil;
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:103224:66"/>
the Devil hath a great Work for thee to do, to damn that Soul of thine, and as many others as thou canſt; The Devil would have thee to Hell with him, and hang up that Soul of thine in Chains of Fire. This he cannot do, unleſs thou wilt put thine own hand to the Work, and now he hath brought thee to it; in the courſe thou art now taking, thou art doing the Devil's Work, to deſtroy thine own Soul. Such thoughts would put Sinners to a ſtand, or at leaſt ſlacken their pace.</p>
               <p>If the Devil ſhould poſſeſs a whole Countrey of People, as he hath ſometimes poſſeſſed ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons, and ſhould ſet them a pulling down their own Houſes, a burning their Corn and their Cattel, a tearing their own fleſh, a pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out their own Eyes, a butchering their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, a pulling out one anothers Throats; who would no the afraid to go dwell in that Countrey, to be hired to that cruel Work? Why, Sinners, 'tis worſe work than this that the Devil hath ſet you upon, and you are now a-doing; He hath ſet you on work to ſtab every Man his own Soul, to ſtrike in Darts through our Livers, to kindle thoſe Fires that will burn to the bottom of Hell, and to caſt your ſelves headlong into thoſe Eternal Flames. Hadſt thou ſuch a thought as this upon thy Heart, didſt thou but conſider that this is it thou art doing, 'twould cool the heat of thy Luſt, and hold thee back, at leaſt from much of that wickedneſs thou art ruſhing upon.</p>
               <p>And ſo it would be here, if Chriſtians did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what 'tis that they are a doing, in their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Holineſs and Righteouſneſs, that they are herein ſerving the Lord, and that in his recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and ſaving Deſign; O how would it provoke them on! How is it that thou art ſuch a ſlow-belly, that thou art ſuch a drone, and ſuch a ſlug in thy Work? Is he whom thou ſerveſt worthy of no more than this? Pluck up thy Spirits Man, thou art upon Service for the God of the whole Earth, and upon the nobleſt Service that thou art capable of; thou art ſent forth upon the ſame Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, for which the Son of God was ſent into the World, to ſave Souls, and to deſtroy the Works of the Devil; <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.20. If God ſhould have employed thee but in thoſe lower Works, that Chriſt did for the Bodies of Men, to open the Eyes of the Blind, to unlooſe the Tongue of the Dumb, to caſt out Devils, to heal the Sick, and raiſe the Dead; wouldſt thou have been ſo unwilling, and ſo backward at ſuch Works? Thou art upon greater Works than theſe, to ſave thine own Soul, and thoſe that ſee and hear thee.</p>
               <p>God hath made thee one of that <hi>Choſen Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that Royal Prieſthood, that Holy Nation,</hi> who are to ſerve him, by <hi>ſhewing forth the Vertues of him that hath called them,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.9. To bear his Name, and to ſet forth his Praiſes in the World; thou art ſet up as the Image of God, as the Epiſtle of Chriſt; thou art ſent forth as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor and Agitator for God, to negotiate for him in the Earth; to bear up his Name, to propagate his Goſpel, to enlarge his Kingdom; Art thou not afraid to trifle in ſuch noble Works?</p>
               <p>Think, O my Soul, what 'tis thou art for, and for whom thou liveſt; Shall I be as the Ox that eateth Graſs, or as the Swine that lyeth in the Mud, and tell the World, behold your King? This is the Image of your God? Shall the Epiſtle
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:103224:67"/>
of Chriſt be nothing elſe but a Blank or Blots? Shall the Factor for Heaven have ſo much of his Occupation for Earth? Shall I teach Men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe, and pollute, and blaſpheme that worthy Name, which I am intruſted to advance and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt? Shall any little that I do, ſuffice me in ſo great a Truſt? Come on, O my Soul, remember thou ſerveſt the Living God, and therefore let me do him the beſt Service I can. Canſt thou be too Holy? Canſt thou be too Circumſpect and too Active? I may be too ſluggiſh, and too ſilent, and too ſhie, and too ſhamefac'd; but can I be too buſie, a too zealous for the Living God? Can I ſay of my beſt, this is too much? Can I ſay of any thing leſs than my beſt, this is enough? 'Tis the Lord God whom thou ſerveſt, fear to be unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. This is the advantage of our carrying this thought upon our Hearts, I ſerve the Lord, it will put us upon the beſt and higheſt Service.</p>
               <p>Give me leave to add another Advantage, (though not of ſo proper conſideration here); This thought, whilſt it provokes us to the higheſt, will yet comfort us, touching the leaſt and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all our Services. Some poor weak Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, are apt to diſcourage themſelves in all they do, from this, that it is ſo very low and little that they do. I am a poor Creature, 'tis but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle that I have to ſerve the Lord withal, I am ignorant and of weak underſtanding, I have not the Parts nor Gifts that others have; I might poſſibly ſerve the Lord better, were it not for this Fear which is upon me; I am afraid to ſpeak of God, or of the Things of God; I am of ſlow Speech, and rude Language, I cannot expreſs my ſelf to any purpoſe; I am aſhamed of my teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:103224:68"/>
my Family, of my praying in my Family; I do it ſo brokenly and confuſedly, that I fear I do more hurt than good in it.</p>
               <p>I but, poor Man, as weak as thou art, and as weakly as thou doſt, what thou doſt, if thou do what thou canſt, This is ſerving the Lord; and whether it be little or much, if thou canſt but truly ſay, This is ſerving the Lord, thou mayſt be comforted in it.</p>
               <p>If Sinners conſidered that their <hi>little</hi> Sins were ſerving the Devil, 'twould make them afraid of the very leaſt tranſgreſſion. Some Sinners are not ſo great Sinners as others, they are not guilty of thoſe higher and more notorious Crimes that ſome others are, and this quiets them and keeps off Fear from them.</p>
               <p>Thou art no Drunkard, thou ſayeſt, nor no Adulterer, nor no Blaſphemer; I, but doſt thou not live a carnal, vain, careleſs, earthly Life? and is not this ſerving the Devil? Though thou doſt not ſerve the Devil in the Ale-houſe, or the Whore-houſe; though thou doſt not ſerve the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil with Oaths, and Curſes, and Blaſphemies, yet is it not the Devil ſtill thou ſerveſt? Thou ſerveſt thy Covetouſneſs, thou ſerveſt thy Pride, and thy ſenſual Appetite; thou neglecteſt Chriſt and thy Soul, and is not this ſerving the Devil? Such a thought, upon the moſt harmleſs of Sinners Hearts, yet I ſerve the Devil, would make him afraid. Is it a light thing to ſerve the Devil? Though I be not numbred among the chief of Sinners, though there be others worſe than I, yet am not I under the ſame Maſter? Though I be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the hindermoſt of the Company, yet am not I one of them? This Life I live, is no ſerving
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:103224:68"/>
God, and therefore 'tis doubtleſs the ſerving of the Devil. Take heed, O my Soul, If the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil can but hold thee, 'twill be all one, whether it be by greater or ſmaller Cords; the Devil is drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging thee to Hell, and ſo he can but get the thither at laſt, it will be upon the matter all one to him whether it be by greater or leſſer Sins. Though he can't perſwade thee to ride poſt into the Pit, yet if he can but toll thee in, that ſhall ſuffice him, though it be but by a ſlower pace.</p>
               <p>Now as ſuch a thought, I ſerve the Devil, would afright the leaſt of Sinners, ſo will ſuch a thought, I ſerve the Lord, comfort the leaſt of Saints. But this by the way.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Another Reaſon why we ſhould Fear, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the great Treaſure we carry about with us, whither-ever we go.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſtians are Travellers, and they travel with <hi>charge</hi> about them. This World is a dangerous World, the Paſſengers through it are in danger of falling among Thieves, which will ſpoil and rob them of their Treaſure.</p>
               <p>A Chriſtian carries more Riches about him than the whole World is worth. He hath the whole Goſpel within him, he hath the two Tables of the Covenant, his Heart is the Ark, in which they are laid up. He hath Chriſt in him, the Fruits of his Blood, his Pardon and Reconciliation; the graces and comforts of his Spirit, his evidences for Heaven; all the Records of the gracious Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions betwixt God and his Soul, the Pawns and Pledges of Divine Love, the King's Broad-Seal, and the Earneſt for Glory; all the Income of his Faith, the Returns of his Prayers, all that he hath

gotten, all the Manna he hath gathered, the Hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Manna, the White Stone, with the New Name, he carries all his Riches up and down with him, whither-ever he travels.</p>
               <p>Haſt thou any Divine Light in thine Heart? any love for Chriſt, any zeal for God and his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, any Tokens of his Love, or Tenderneſs of his Honour? Is there Peace, or Joy, or Hope within thee? All this thou art in danger of being rob'd and ſpoil'd of.</p>
               <p>This is the Deſign that Satan hath upon thee, this is the Errand of every Worldly Luſt, of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Temptation, every Companion, every Carnal Relation, every Change of Condition, every Carnal Pleaſure, all thy Earthly Poſſeſſions; the Devil hath ſet them in ambuſh, and they lie in wait for thee, to rifle thee and ſpoil thee of all that ever thou art worth.</p>
               <p>Haſt thou never fallen amongſt theſe Thieves, and ſuffered great loſs by them? Haſt thou been rob'd, and art thou not afraid thou mayeſt again? Will not thy loſs make thee more wiſe and wary?</p>
               <p>How many Inſtances have there been of ſecure and unwary Chriſtians, who, whilſt they have been venturous upon Temptations, have truſted themſelves amongſt their vain Companions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged themſelves a more free, and jolly, and eaſie, a more remiſs, and fleſh pleaſing Life, or a more buſie drudgery for this VVorld, have, (as to their ſenſe at leaſt) loſt all they had for the other VVorld; VVho when they have come a little to themſelves, fall a mourning out <hi>Naomi</hi>'s bitter Song; Ruth. 1.20. <hi>Call me no more</hi> Naomi, <hi>but call me</hi> Marah; I went out full, but I returned

empty. Whilſt mine Heart was tender, and mine Eye jealous; whilſt I kept my watch, and kept my diſtance from this World and its Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; O, what Light, Love, Peace, Joy, did then ſhine upon and poſſeſs my Heart? then I had a God, whom I could call mine own; then I had a Jeſus, and could lean upon my Beloved; then I could believe, love, ſerve, delight in, enjoy, and praiſe the Lord.</p>
               <p>But wo, wo to me, how is it now? Whilſt I allowed my ſelf a little more boldneſs, with this Fleſh and this World, I have even loſt all ere I was aware. I am fallen among Thieves, and what have they left me?</p>
               <p>O mine Eaſe, my Pleaſures, my Money, my Lands, which I have turned aſide to, how have you ſerved me? Whilſt I have been loving, and following, and ſerving you, how have you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded me? Ah me, they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him. Grace is not, Peace is no more to me, a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, where is it become?

               <p>Chriſtians, Are there no ſuch Inſtances, no ſuch Caſes in the World? And is there no fear that this may be any of your caſes? Do not [you] alſo travel with Charge? have you not a Treaſure within you? What, have you been Profeſſors ſo long, Believers ſo long; have you been Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Praying, and Faſting, and Labouring all this while, and have not gotten ſomething you would be loth to loſe? And is not the World ſtill as very a Thief as ever? Does not the Devil lye in

wait for you as well as for others? Is not his Eye upon that Chain about thy Neck, that Jewel in thy Boſom, and thoſe Bracelets upon thy Hands, the Graces that appear upon thee? and hath he not a mind to beguile thee of them all? Are his Temptations ſo weak, or art thou ſo ſtrong, that thou needeſt not fear them? As I told thee once heretofore, ſo I now tell thee again, He that is ſo weak as not to fear Temptations, is certainly not ſo ſtrong as to reſiſt them. Look to thy ſelf, they are all ſtanding at the catch for thee; thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions are catching, thine Eſtate is catching, thy Buſineſe is catching, thy Pleaſures are all catching at thee, to ſpoil thee of all that ever thou haſt.</p>

How would ſuch a Day be prized in Hell? If the Miniſters that are now ſent to thee, were ſent down amongſt thoſe damned Souls that are bound in Chains of Darkneſs, to carry down the Goſpel to them? O, if thoſe miſerable Souls might have one Sabbath more, one hour of Grace more, one Sermon more of Repentance and Reconciliation preached unto them, how would their ſhrieks and howlings be turned into ſhouts and acclamations of joy?

                  <p>But as low as Men rate it, a Soul is worth a Kingdom; all the Kingdoms in the World will not buy it from his hands, who knows it's worth. All the Crowns, and Scepters, and Thrones, and Dominions of all the Earth, put all together, one

Yea, who in the World hath greater reaſon to fear than thou? Is thy Soul ſo precious? Is thy Soul in danger of being loſt?

Meekneſs, Temperance, Patience, Charity, Chaſtity; Preaching, Praying, Faſting, all our Religion muſt be preſs'd to do ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to this Idol; and whatſoever would be a diſgrace, whether it be good or evil, muſt be laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, or trodden under-foot. If it be a diſgrace to be covetous, Pride will be content to be poor; if it be a diſgrace to be quarrelſom, Pride will be peaceable; yea, if it be a diſgrace to be proud, Humility muſt ſerve it for a Covering and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If it be an honour to be Godly and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious, the Proud will be a Profeſſor; and if it be a diſgrace or reproach, then farewel to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Conſcience hide thine head. Every thing muſt be entertained or rejected, according as it may ſerve or hinder it, and this Pride muſt have the ordering and diſpoſing of all.</p>
               <p>If Covetouſneſs be the Maſter-Sin, then all we are or have muſt be at its command. The Senſual Appetite muſt be denyed, and Hunger and Thirſt muſt be born for its ſake; Expenſive Pride, or Waſteful Prodigality, muſt no longer be endured; Slothfulneſs and Idleneſs muſt by no means be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:103224:73"/>
to; All our time, wits, parts, ſtrength; all thoſe vices, injuſtice, oppreſſion, unmerciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, muſt be hired to gather in Duſt, to feed this greedy Worm. And the like may be ſaid of any other Beloved Sin, it hath the command of all.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It muſt have no check nor controul.</hi> The Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved muſt dwell in quiet, do what I will, and none muſt ſay to it, What doſt thou? Like that Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Adonijah,</hi> of whom 'tis ſaid, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 1.6. <hi>His Father had not diſpleaſed him at any time, nor ſaid, Why haſt thou done ſo?</hi> The Darling muſt be dandled, but never corrected or queſtioned; or if there be a neceſſity, and it cannot be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ſome check be given it, then the ſame charge muſt be given as concerning that other of <hi>David</hi>'s Fondlings, <hi>Abſalom,</hi> 2 Sam. 18.5. <hi>Deal gently with the young Man.</hi> Not too harſh, not too cloſe; <hi>Nay, my Sons, 'tis not well that I hear of you,</hi> ſaid <hi>Eli</hi> to his wicked Sons, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.24. And that's the hardeſt word that will be born.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>It's the laſt that's parted with. Reuben</hi> ſhall go, and <hi>Simeon</hi> ſhall go, and <hi>Judah</hi> ſhall go; but muſt <hi>Benjamin</hi> go to? My Son ſhall not go down, ſaid once old <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Gen. 42. this Pride let it go, ſayes the <hi>covetous</hi> Man, and this Sloth, and this Pleaſure; but muſt this <hi>Mammon</hi> and my Heart be parted? it ſhall not go. This Covetouſneſs, let it go, ſaith the <hi>proud</hi> Man, and this Eaſe and this Pleaſure, but ſhall this Honour and theſe Ornaments go? If I be put to Labour, I can bear it; or if I be Poor, I can bear it: I can work hard, or fare hard, but I cannot be deſpiſed; though my Eſtate be brought low, and my Back be bowed down, yet my Spirit will not come down; this Pleaſure I can ſpare, and this Eaſe,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:103224:73"/>
and this Honour, ſaith the <hi>peeviſh,</hi> but I cannot help it to be angry and impatient when I am pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, Nature will have its vent; any thing but this, but in this thing, the Lord pardon me, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>It's often the parting penny, betwixt Chriſt and the Soul, betwixt the Soul and Life.</hi> 'Tis the laſt that's parted with, and ſometimes 'twill never be parted with. Chriſt muſt go, and Life muſt go; the Soul muſt die, rather than this Sin not be ſaved alive. Doubtleſs there are Souls in Hell, that have parted with much, and would have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with all but this one thing, their Beloved Sin; and for the ſake of this they periſh everlaſtingly. Was it not the care of that young Man that came to Chriſt for Eternal Life? <hi>Mark</hi> 10.21. He was fair for Life, only Chriſt tells him, <hi>One thing thou lackeſt.</hi> Get thee looſe from the love of this Earth, and Heaven ſhall be thine. O, ſayes his Heart, I have too much to loſe, and I love it too well to part with it ſo; ſorry I am I cannot: I have a good will to thee, I have a mind to live, abate me but this and I will be thine; but if this may not be, away he goes, ſorry he muſt die, but yet chuſing Death, rather than the loſs of that Idol, his great Eſtate.</p>
               <p>Now, Friends, Is not ſuch a Sin to be feared? that will find ſuch an eaſie entrance that has the command of all, by which your Souls and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, all your Parts and Powers, all your Time, and Eſtates, and Wayes, are governed and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; that muſt do what it will, without check or controul; that you can ſo hardly get rid of, and will ſo greatly hazard your foregoing for ever your part in Chriſt; if any thing in the World be like
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:103224:74"/>
to keep you off, or draw you back from him, this is it that will do it, your Beloved Sin; Is not ſuch a Sin to be feared?</p>
               <p>Well, by what hath been ſaid you may find it out, and know which it is; or it may be, there may be more than one of them; ſome Sinners ſerve many Maſters, and know not which is the chief. Fear all your Sins, and do what you can to find out <hi>the Maſter-Sin,</hi> and take heed of it where-ever you meet it. Never count thy ſelf in the leaſt ſafety; whilſt that Luſt is alive, reward it as it would ſerve thee; Put thy finger upon the right Head, and then ſay, <hi>Thou muſt die Jonathan;</hi> thou muſt die, O my Sin, or my Soul muſt die by thine hand. But of this more hereafter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Fear your</hi> Jezebels, <hi>or your painted Sins.</hi> An Enemy in a diſguiſe is the more to be feared, as his advantage againſt us is the greater. The Devil is a Painter, that can limn ſome of the fouleſt Vices into the form of Vertues. As he can put an ugly vizor upon goodneſs, and with this fooliſh World, make Light paſs for Darkneſs, Holineſs for Hypocriſie, Tenderneſs for Trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs, Zeal for Pride and Fury; ſo can he paint Sin into the form of Godlineſs. Covetouſneſs muſt go for Frugality, Profuſeneſs for Liberality, Sinful Complyance for Civility, Sinful Conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence for Modeſty, Lukewarmneſs for Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Cowardice and Faint-heartedneſs for Prudence and Diſcretion.</p>
               <p>Haſt thou never a painted <hi>Jezabel</hi> with thee? No Luſt, nor Vice, which thou alloweſt thy ſelf in, thinking there's no harm in it? Fear this Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, that looks more modeſtly than her that hath

Let it down with this <hi>Jezebel.</hi> Pull off the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots Vail, and caſt her out. <hi>Come in,</hi> yea rather, Get thee out <hi>thou Wife of</hi> Jeroboam, <hi>why feigneſt thou thy ſelf to be another?</hi> Is this thy Frugality or Providence, to hoord up and hold back what the Lord calls for from thee? Is this thy good Husbandry? Too good an Husband to be Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; too good an Husband to be a good Chriſtian: Get thee out thou Wife of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> get thee out Covetouſneſs, why feigneſt thou thy ſelf to be another? Is this thy liberality, to ſpend thine Eſtate upon Harlots, or thy looſe and vain Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions? Muſt thy luxury and thy riot eat up all thou haſt? Is this thy caſting thy Bread upon the Waters, to throw it down thoſe filthy Kennels? Get thee out Prodigal, why feigneſt thou thy ſelf to be another? Is this thy civility, to have fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the unfruitful Works of Darkneſs, to hold friendſhip and intimacy with the lewd ones of the Earth, to have a kiſs for the precious and the vile? Get thee out <hi>Ambo-dexter,</hi> why feigneſt thou thy ſelf to be another? Art thou remiſs and indifferent in the Matters of God? Art thou cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly, and faint-hearted, where his honour is concerned; and is this thy Moderation or thy Prudence? Get thee out <hi>Laodicean,</hi> why feigneſt thou thy ſelf to be another?</p>
               <p>Friend, pull off the Mask from the Face, and ſee what's under. Thou knoweſt not what miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief thou mayeſt ſuffer, where thou ſuſpected no harm; Fear a pretended Friend more than an open Enemy.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:103224:75"/>3. <hi>Fear your</hi> Iſaacs, <hi>any beloved or over loved Creature.</hi> Fear not only the ſins of thy love, but the Sons of thy love; the latter will be temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the former; thou mayeſt receive hurt from that which hath no hurt in it; an Innocent Child may be an Idol, and ſo may thine Husband, or thy Wife, or any Friend thou haſt. <hi>Wherefore honoureſt thou thy Sons above me?</hi> 1 Sam. 2.29.</p>
               <p>Fear, leſt thy love to thy Friend make an abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon thy love to thy God; thy love to thy Children ſhould cauſe thee to abuſe thy God and them, by the neglect of that dury of Reproof and Correction thou oweſt them; take heed that thy tendernes to them, make thee not cruel to them and thy ſelf; By nurſing their untowardneſs, thou nouriſheſt thoſe Thorns that will pierce through thine own Soul.</p>
               <p>Take heed thou have never an <hi>Iſaac</hi> in all the World, not one Child, not one Relation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which, if God ſhould ſay to thee as to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 22. Offer up this <hi>Iſaac</hi> whom thou loveſt; or if Chriſt require of thee, as he doth of all his Diſciples, Forſake Father or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, forſake Husband or VVife, forſake Son or Daughter; take heed leſt thine Heart ſhould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, No, I will not offer them up, no, I cannot forſake them. VVhat thou canſt not part with, may be the parting of God and thy Soul.</p>
               <p>And as any Beloved Friend, ſo any other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Affair that thine Heart is ſet upon, may be a ſnare to thee. Fear that Houſe that thou loveſt, thy pleaſant Habitation; Fear thy Money, and thy Fields, and thy Flocks, thy Meat and thy Drink that thou loveſt; thoſe Buſineſſes and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Employments thou takeſt moſt pleaſure in.
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:103224:75"/>
Thy good things may become thine evil things; thy Table may become thy Snare, thy ſavoury Meat may become thy Poiſon, and that which is given thee for thy good, may be an occaſion of falling. Thy Money may be thy Poverty, and thine honeſt Labours, when thine Heart is too much in them, may be more miſchievous than Idleneſs. How many fooliſh Souls are there, whom their Love hath held Priſoners to this Earth, and Exiles from Heaven; to whom their good things have done more miſchief, than things apparently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful could ever do them?</p>
               <p>How is it, Chriſtian, that thy Soul is ſo ſeldom Above? O, thy delights are below. VVhence is it that thou haſt ſuffered ſo great loſs in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of thy Soul? That whatſoever thou doſt in the Matters of Religion proſpers no more; that ſo ſmall increaſes, and ſo many decayes are to be found upon thee? Thou haſt not been among the Drunkards, nor haſt been partaker with the Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers; thou haſt not been walking in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the Ungodly, nor ſtanding in the way of Sinners, nor ſitting in the Seat of the Scornful, thou haſt been no Lyar, or Scoffer, or Oppreſſor; theſe things thy Soul abhors. O, but thou haſt been an Idolater; thine Heart hath found thee out ſome Idol in the Earth, ſome Friend, or ſome Farm, or ſome honeſt Buſineſs, or ſome innocent Pleaſure, (as thou thoughteſt) and hath ſo chained it ſelf to theſe, and been ſo taken up in the ſervice of them, that hence 'tis with thee as 'tis. God hath opened his Store to thee, and filled thine hand with good things, and thou haſt opened thy Mouth, and ſo filled thine Heart with them,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:103224:76"/>
that it's even chok'd up by them, and all Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Good is even ſtrangled within thee.</p>
               <p>But wilt thou thus requite the Lord, O un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Soul? Shall he be a loſer by his Bounty? VVilt thou become worſe, for that he is ſo good? VVilt thou abuſe Love? VVhat is an abuſe of Love, if not this, that the more he loves, the leſs he is beloved of thee? the more he gives, the leſs be returned; what was given to draw thine Heart, doe's carry it away from him? Shall it be ſaid, thou wouldſt have been a better Servant, if he had not been ſo good a Maſter? If he had not given thee ſo great an Eſtate, ſo good a VVife, ſo dear a Child, thou wouldſt have lov'd him more, and ſerv'd him better than now thou doſt?</p>
               <p>Friends, if what you Love be not alſo your Fear, it will be like to be your Sin and your Miſery. 'Twill draw your Heart from God, and ſo 'twill be your Sin, and 'twill provoke God to ſnatch it away from you, and then 'twill be your Miſery. What-ever thou over-loveſt, if the Lord mean thee good, look for it, to be ſtrip't and bereaved of it. He will touch thee in the Apple of thine Eye, he will try thee in thine <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and will tear off that Jewel, that entices thine Heart from him. And by how much the more thou loveſt, by ſo much the greater will the parting torment be.</p>
               <p>Good old <hi>Abraham</hi> had an <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and in this <hi>Iſaac</hi> he muſt be tried, and an hard tryal he had; which how chearfully ſoever he went through, yet conſider the Circumſtances of it, and then think what piercing trouble thy love to Creatures may bring upon thee.</p>
               <p>Gen. 22.2. <hi>Take now</hi> (ſayes God to <hi>Abraham) thy Son, thine only Son</hi> Iſaac <hi>[whom thou loveſt] —
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:103224:76"/>
and offer him up for a Burnt-Offering.</hi> Hadſt thou been in this <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſtead, what a Dagger in thine Heart would this Word have been? How would thy love to thine <hi>Iſaac</hi> have riſen up, and reaſoned with the Lord thus?</p>
               <p>If the Lord will have a Sacrifice, may not ſome other Creature be it? All the Beaſts of the Field are his, and the Cattel upon a thouſand Hills. Is there none amongſt all theſe, wherewith the Lord will be pleaſed, but muſt he have a Man for a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice?</p>
               <p>If he will have me Sacrifice a Man, may not a Stranger be the Man? Or if he will have one of mine own Houſe, may not a Servant, or one of their Sons be accepted? If it muſt be a Son of mine own, may not <hi>Iſhmael</hi> the Son of the Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman be he? Muſt it be mine <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and none but he? And why Lord is this word <hi>[whom thou loveſt]</hi> added? What yet more load? 'Twould be ſome eaſe, if I could now forget my love, and muſt this be now remembred? This is the Dart that kills my Soul.</p>
               <p>But if this Son of mine, this only Son [by my Wife] this <hi>Iſaac</hi> whom I love muſt go, muſt I my ſelf offer him up? muſt mine own hand be upon him? If this <hi>Iſaac</hi> muſt be the Sacrifice, muſt none but <hi>Abraham</hi> be the Prieſt? O, what will the Countrey ſay of me, Is <hi>Abraham</hi> become a Murtherer? And how ſhall I hold up my face to <hi>Sarah</hi> my Wife at my return? What ſhall I ſay to her, when ſhe asks, Where is the Child? where is <hi>Iſaac</hi> my Son? O my Bowels, my Bowels, I am pained at mine Heart, mine Eyes fail, my Soul melts, my Livey is poured out on the Earth. How ſhall I ſay, <hi>Iſaac</hi> is not, the Child is dead,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:103224:77"/>
and dead by mine own hand? How would Father and Mother fall together, and ſwoon and die as wounded in the ſtreets?</p>
               <p>How chearfully and couragiouſly ſoever, the good old Man behaved himſelf, under all theſe aſtoniſhing Circumſtances; yet, O think, how it would have been with thee, hadſt thou been this <hi>Abrabam,</hi> and let that thought put thee in fear, concerning whomſoever thou dearly loveſt.</p>
               <p>Conſider a little what the unhappy Fruits of thy own love are;</p>
               <p>God ſayes to thee, Take now thy Child, or thy Children, not and offer them up to me for a Burnt-Sacrifice, but take and bring them up for me for an Holy Seed; Inſtruct them, Govern and Educate them for me. Whoſe are all theſe that are in thine Houſe? Are they not all mine, my Sons and my Daughters? and wherefore have I ſent them thee? Is it not with this charge, Keep theſe Souls for me, bring them up for me? 'Tis not for Bread only, or for Clothes, or for Trades, or for Portions that they are come into thine Houſe, 'tis that they may be inſtructed to the Kingdom of God, and bred up to eternal Life.</p>
               <p>Now how doſt thou keep this charge of the Lord? Doſt thou Teach them? Doſt thou Govern them? Or are they not left a rude and unruly Company? But what is in the fault? Is not thy love in fault? Thou art ſo fond a Father, that thou canſt not find in thine Heart to impoſe upon them any thing that they like not, nor canſt be ſo ſtrict or ſevere as is needful to them. My Child is ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or unapt to learn, and I cannot put him ſo hard to it; My Child is wayward and diſorderly, but I doubt how it would be with him if I ſhould
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:103224:77"/>
croſs or correct him; I am fain to let him have his Will more than I would, for fear I ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage or break his Spirit. I have but one, or but two, and if theſe ſhould miſcarry, what would become of me?</p>
               <p>Why now, thou ſees what reaſon thou haſt to fear thy love, which is ſuch a Tempter to thee to diſobey thy God, and to tender the honour of thy Child more than the honour of thy Maker. If there be ever a one of thy Children that thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt above the reſt, that muſt be let alone to be the rebellious Child.</p>
               <p>God ſayes to thee, Take not thy Child, but thy Bread, and thy Fleſh, and thy Money, and Eſtate, and offer theſe up to me. Caſt thy Bread upon the Waters. Draw forth thy Soul to the hungry. Give unto him that asketh; lend unto him that would borrow of thee; feed, cloath, harbour; for my ſake do it. And yet how little goes out at his Word, either to Beggars or Borrowers? No, thou loveſt what thou haſt too well to part with it ſo.</p>
               <p>God ſayes to thee, Take but this Ram, or this Goat, thy Sins and thy Luſts, ſlay them and offer them up. No, thou wilt not do it. Thou loveſt thine Enemies too, and they alſo muſt be ſpared. Though they will not ſpare thee, nor any thing thou haſt; thy Time, thine Eſtate, thy Name, and all that thou haſt muſt be Meat for thy Luſts; yet behold, they are loved, and muſt be ſpared, thou wilt not deliver them up.</p>
               <p>God ſayes ſometimes to thee, Not take thou thy Child, but let me take him, be content that I lay mine hand upon him, and ſmite him with
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:103224:78"/>
Sickneſs or Death. No, thou canſt not bear it, but takeſt on, and murmureſt, and art impatient, and wilt not be comforted or quieted.</p>
               <p>Some Parents can better bear it that the Devil ſhould take their Children, than that God ſhould take them. If the Devil takes thy Child, and makes a Prodigal Child of him, makes a Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard of him, or a Rioter, if evil Company car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him away from thee into the Paths of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer, thou canſt bear it with more patience, though poſſibly it be ſome trouble to thee. At leaſt, if the Devil take him, and only make him a greedy Worldling or Muck-worm, though that make him a ſure to Hell as Prodigality, yet this thou canſt bear with eaſe. Though we may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hear Parents ſay, I had rather my Child had been dead, it would not have been ſuch an afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to me to have followed him to his Grave, as it is to ſee him buried alive in Lewdneſs and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery; yet to ſee him held by the Devil under a blind Mind, under an hard and impenitent Heart, ſo he be civil, and ſober, and thirty for this World; though he be but a civil Infidel, a thrifty Unbeliever, this is not ſo heavily taken: But let God lay hands upon him, and take him away out of the World, and then no other noiſe is heard in the Houſe, but ſuch as was heard in <hi>Ramah,</hi> Matth. 2.18. <hi>Lamentation and weeping, and great mourning,</hi> Rachel <hi>weeping for her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and would not be comforted, becauſe they were not.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Not out of tenderneſs to our Bodies.</hi> 'Tis this which makes us ſhrink from, and ſhun the Croſs, that it is ſuch a trouble to our outward Man, that it puts it to ſo much pain and hardſhip. The Soul ſuffers not immediately by any thing that Man can do unto us, but as it partakes in the ſufferings of the Body. If our Bodies could bear with Eaſe their own Infirmities, the Soul could not feel them; what the Body cannot endure, makes the Soul ſick, becauſe of its tenderneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it. Upon this account 'tis that we fear bodily Afflictions, but thus it muſt not be. A Chriſtian is a Souldier, and Souldier muſt not fear, but endure hardneſs. 2 Tim. 2.3. <hi>Endure hardneſs as a good Souldier of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It is not for tender Perſons to be Souldiers; hunger and thirſt, cold and wearineſs is their ordinary lot; and their hardneſs muſt be their Armour
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:103224:79"/>
againſt all. It is not for tender Perſons to be Souldiers, and therefore it is not for Chriſtians to be tender; the moſt tender of Sin, of any Perſons in the World, but not ſo of Sufferings.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral kinds of Sufferings we may be expoſed to; ſome fall at a greater diſtance, when we are ſmitten only in our Goods or Eſtates; others come nearer, and touch our Fleſh and our Bones; and theſe are they that are hardeſt born: The Devil, in his tempting <hi>Job,</hi> knew which was the tender part, and therefore reſerves that for his laſt trial. Job 2.5. <hi>Put forth thine hand now, and touch his Bone and his Fleſh, and he will curſe thee to thy face.</hi> And if this tender part once becomes hardy, then thou art a Souldier fit to fight the Devil and his Armies. Chriſtian, be not tender of thy Fleſh, and then thou wilt not thence fear Sufferings.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Much leſs is the Croſs to be feared, out of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs to our fleſhly Luſts.</hi> Here let three things be conſidered;

                     <item>1. <hi>The Intention of the Croſs, is the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Fleſh.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>'Tis this corrupt Fleſh that makes the Croſs to pinch.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. <hi>This Fleſh is no ſuch Friend to us, that for its ſake the Croſs ſhould be feared.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Intention of the Croſs, is the Deſtruction of the Fleſh.</hi> Afflictions, as ill-favouredly as they look, come to us upon no ill intent; 'tis to ſave us from that which is worſe. God delivers his
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:103224:79"/>
People up to the Croſs, to the ſame end for which the Church was to deliver up Offenders to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, <hi>for the deſtruction of the Fleſh, that the Spirit may be ſaved in the Day of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> Sin muſt be put to death, and it muſt be put to the ſame death which Chriſt was put to, it muſt be Crucified. Rom. 6.6. <hi>Our Old Man is Crucified with him.</hi> [Our old Man] I, that's the Male-factor that muſt be executed on the Croſs. God would have the Souls of his People to live and thrive; in warm weather the moſt hopeful Blades are even chok'd up with Weeds, then come the Froſts, to kill the Weeds and ſave the Corn.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>'Tis this corrupt Fleſh that makes the Croſs to pinch:</hi> 'Tis the Fleſh that's ſtruck at, and 'tis that that ſmarts; Afflictions would fall more eaſie on mortified Hearts. Dead Fleſh cannot feel. And therefore 'tis, that what-ever complaints and groanings are heard from mortified Chriſtians, 'tis uſually much more for their Sins than for their Sufferings. Their Medicine is ſharp, and puts them hard to it at firſt to bear it, but when it hath a little conquered their Diſeaſe, much of its tart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is allayed. 'Tis their Sore or Diſeaſe that makes them ſo full of pain.</p>
               <p>What's the reaſon that <hi>loſſes in Mens Eſtates,</hi> the ſpoiling of their Goods, that Poverty ſo vexes their Hearts, and puts them into ſuch fits of Impatience? O, 'tis their <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> and the Cares of this Life, that are the Teeth of Poverty and Want. Had we once mortified our earthly Members, and learn'd in every Eſtate to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, how eaſie would loſſes be?</p>
               <p>What's the reaſon that <hi>contempt and diſgrace</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:103224:80"/>
raiſes ſuch a ſtorm in others? 'Tis their <hi>Pride</hi> that cannot be patient. He whoſe Heart is humble, can be content to be humbled and laid low. The like may be ſaid in all other afflictive caſes; 'tis Luſt that makes Affliction tedious.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Fleſh is no ſuch Friend to us, that for its ſake we ſhould fear the Croſs.</hi> 'Tis near us 'tis true, and cannot ſuffer, but we our ſelves ſuffer and are pained in it; But ſo 'tis, with an Ulcer in the Body, 'tis in thine own Fleſh, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſmart is felt, 'tis thou that feeleſt it; but would'ſt thou therefore fear to have thy Wound cured?</p>
               <p>Chriſtian, wouldſt thou have thy Luſts live? Doſt thou not pray for their Deſtruction? Doſt thou not ſigh and groan under them? Doſt thou not wiſh, and wait, and hope, and long for thy Redemption from them? Doſt thou count them as Enemies, and art thou afraid of that Weapon, that's now put into thine hand to avenge thee of thine Enemies?</p>

                  <p>I would be glad this Fleſh might die, but O may it not be put to an eaſier death? 'Tis not their death that I fear, but thoſe Inſtruments of death that are ſo tormenting.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Then ſave thy ſelf that torment, by laying thine own hand upon them.</hi> Prevent thy need of the Croſs, by doing its Work thy ſelf. Let it be

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Muſt they die an eaſie death? What, or elſe wilt thou not that they die at all?</hi> Will it be ſo eaſie for thy Soul to die by their hand, that thou wilt rather venture on that, than a little preſent trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? Shall thy right hand, or thy right foot, caſt thee and carry thee to Hell, becauſe it would be painful to cut them off and caſt them from thee? Is it become ſo eaſie to thee, to be in bondage to theſe <hi>Egyptians,</hi> that thou wilt rather ſerve at the Brick-kilns, than venture for thy Redemption on the hazards of the Red-Sea, or the hardſhips of the Wilderneſs? Fear this Fleſh more than thou doſt, and that Servitude it holds thee under, and that future Miſery it's dragging thee to; Fear this more, and then thou wilt not fear thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, by what means ſoever it be brought about. Thou wilt not ſay, Deal gently with mine Enemy, deal tenderly with this Fleſh; Let it die Lord, let it die; let me be delivered from the Body of this Death, and I will not preſcribe to thee for the way and means.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Fear not the Croſs out of faintneſs of Spirit-Faint not when thou art chaſtned,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.5. much leſs before-hand, before the chaſtning comes.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall put in a word or two, as Cordials, to preſerve from fainting. Let theſe two things be conſidered.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="152" facs="tcp:103224:81"/>1. <hi>The Lord is his Peoples God.</hi> This is his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with them; Jer. 30.22. <hi>I will be your God, and you ſhall be my People.</hi> Let us conſider a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, what great ſupport this Promiſe yields. I will be your God. What's the meaning of that? What is there in this more than every one may lay claim to? Is he not the God of all the Earth? Is he not the Sinner's God? Is he not the Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard's God, the Atheiſt's God, the God of them that ſay in their Hearts there is no God? He is ſo; The God that made them, the God that rules them, the God that Judges and will Condemn them.</p>
                  <p>This is a word of terror to the ungodly World. I am their God, that is, I am above them; as high as any of them are, I am higher than they, and will bring them down to the Duſt of Death.</p>
                  <p>But what is there in this word as to Believers? What meaneth the moſt High, when he ſpeaks this word, <hi>I will be your God,</hi> to them? The meaning is this, I will be your God in Covenant, I will be your Friend and your Father, your Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Heritage, your Rock and your Refuge for ever. I am the Almighty God, and able to ſave you from all your diſtreſſes; I am the All-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent God, and able to ſupply all your Wants and Neceſſities, and whatſoever I am all is yours.</p>
                  <p>Now Friend, when God ſayes I am thine, what matters it, who or what can ſay, I am none of thine. Suppoſe the gods of the Earth ſhould ſay to thee, Away, we are none of thine: Suppoſe thine old Friends and Acquaintance ſhould ſay, Stand back, we are none of thine: Suppoſe thy
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:103224:81"/>
neareſt Relations, thy Father, or thy Brother, or thine Husband, or thy Wife ſhould ſay, We are none of thine: Suppoſe thine Houſe and thy Countrey ſhould caſt thee out, and ſay, neither are we thine: Yet this one word from the Lord, but <hi>I am thine,</hi> how would it ſupport and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſatisfie thy Soul?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>None ſo well know this ordinarily, that the Lord is their God, as his ſuffering People.</hi> It may be thou wilt ſay, Ah this word, this word, <hi>I am thine,</hi> what a good word is here? O were I but ſure it were ſpoken to me, what then ſhould I fear? Let the Lord but ſpeak thus to [my] Soul, I will be thy God; and then let the World and the Devil too, ſpeak what they can; we'l be thine Enemies, if God be thy Friend; we'l curſe thee, if God bleſs thee; we'l hunt thee, if God harbour thee; we'l ſtick in thy ſides, if God be in thine heart; we'l lay thee low enough, if God exalt thee; we'l be thy death, if he be thy life. Well, even do your worſt, were I but ſure the Lord hath ſaid this word to me, I will be thy God, I will not fear though ye all be Devils unto me.</p>
                  <p>But O here's my great trouble, 'tis this which ſinks my Soul, and makes mine Heart to faint within me; I ſee the World running againſt me, I ſee Troubles running upon me, and I am in great doubt whether God hath ſpoken this word to me, <hi>I will be thine.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>God doth often reveal himſelf in a Storm, who hid himſelf from us in our Sunſhine.</hi> Our dayes of Darkneſs, are often the times of Light and Love. Light from Above is moſt needed, and will be better accepted when 'tis darkeſt below. The ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of the World, doth uſually uſher in the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of Divine Love. When thou art led into a Wilderneſs to be tempted and tryed, there thou mayeſt expect he will ſpeak comfortably to thee, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.14. Why art thou afraid of Affliction? Wouldſt thou not be glad to know the Lord is thine? Follow him into the Wilderneſs, and that may be the Vineyard where he will ſhew thee his Loves.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Sufferings of the Saints will be a Proof of their Sonſhip.</hi> Heb. 12.7. <hi>If ye endure chaſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, God dealeth with you as with Sons.</hi> Our Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for Chriſt, will be the evidence of our Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity to him. Prove that thou loveſt Chriſt above all, and thou therein proveſt that God is thine; and what greater evidence that we love Chriſt above all, than this, that we can part with all things for him?</p>
                  <p>But then indeed it is neceſſary, that we be well aſſured, that 'tis from Love to Chriſt we ſuffer;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:103224:82"/>
there are Carnal Motives that may carry Men far into a ſuffering State. Pride may do much this way, or we may take up our Croſſes for company. Some that are engaged with a ſuffering Party, the fear of the reproach of deſerting them, may make them aſhamed to deſert them; they may expoſe themſelves to ſuffer reproach, for fear of reproach. That Idol, their own Names, may be the God for whoſe ſake they ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>Such Suffering only as will prove thee to be Godly, will prove that God is thine. If you ſhould ſuffer the loſs of all things, and be utterly ruined and undone in the World, and all this up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of Chriſtianity. If you ſhould ſuffer Death for the Name of Chriſt, and yet not have the Love of Chriſt in you, as 'tis clear from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3. Men may do; though you ſhould be thus perſecuted, and rejected of, and troden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-foot of Men, yet at laſt you may be reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God, and periſh everlaſtingly.</p>
                  <p>This would be a dreadful thing in all your Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, to have ſuch a thought upon your Hearts, That you that profeſs Chriſt, and thoſe that perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute you for it; you that come together to Pray, and Hear, and Faſt, and thoſe that Curſe and Swear againſt you for it, may fall into the ſame Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and yet doubtleſs ſo it will prove in the end; If you love not the Lord Jeſus in ſincerity, what-ever you ſuffer for him, you and they muſt dwell in the ſame Fire together; may be theirs may be the hotter, but the ſame Hell muſt hold Perſecutors and Hypocrites.</p>
                  <p>Bare ſuffering therefore will not be your evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for Heaven; But yet Chriſtians that are
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:103224:83"/>
ſincere, and knew it not before, the Croſs may prove their ſincerity. Grace is never ſo well known as when it is put to the tryal. Your Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings will be your tryals; the tryal of your Faith, the tryal of your Love, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6, 7. that ſo what lay in the dark before, may now be found unto Praiſe and Glory.</p>
                  <p>What ſayeſt thou now, how canſt thou faint under ſuch Expectations? Wilt thou fear to be comforted? What greater comfort, than to have it proved to thee that thou art of God? And when will that proof be made with the greateſt evidence, but when thou art tryed in the Fire? 'Tis the Wind that diſcovers the Wheat, and the Fire that proves the Gold.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>How we ſhould fear the Croſs.</hi> To this I ſhall anſwer in theſe two particulars.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Fear a ſurpriſal by the Croſs.</hi> Fear leſt it ſhould overtake you unawares. The coming of the Lord to viſit us, is never ſo terrible as it is, when 'tis as the coming of the Lord of that evil Servant to reckon with him; Luke 12.46. <hi>In a day that he looked not for him, in an hour that he is not aware.</hi> Luke 21.34. <hi>Take heed leſt at any time your hearts be overcharged,—and ſo that day come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you unawares.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>This coming of the Lord finds ſome, as the coming of the Bridgroom <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. found the fooliſh Virgins, <hi>all aſleep.</hi> Others it overtakes, as <hi>David</hi> and his Armies did the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> 1 Sam. 30.16. it finds them <hi>eating, and drinking, and dancing, and making merry.</hi> On others it comes, as the news of <hi>Siſera</hi>'s death came to his Mother and her Ladies, finding them <hi>full of expectations of proſperity and triumph.</hi> Judg. 5.28. <hi>The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of</hi> Siſera <hi>looked out at a Window, and cryed through the Latteſs, why is his Chariot ſo long a coming? Why tarry the Wheels of his Chariot?</hi> They anſwered, <hi>Have they not ſped? Have they not divided the Prey? To every Man a Damoſel or two,</hi> &amp;c. They were full of expectations of his return in triumph; but the next news they heard of, was of the Nail and the Hammer, wherewith he was ſmitten dead to the ground. O what confuſion and aſtoniſhment did this bring upon them?</p>
                  <p>How few of us are there, Friends, that can ſay of the troubles that befal us, as <hi>Job</hi> did of his, <hi>Job</hi> 3.25. <hi>The evil that I feared is come upon me?</hi> But how very few of us can ſay, The Evil that I am prepared for is come upon me? it found me on my Watch-Tower, and ſtanding upon the Guard. I am ready, I am ready; ready for Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ready for Poverty, ready for Bonds and Impriſonment, or any thing elſe that may befal me.</p>

Then we take on, and fret, and murmur, and deſpond, and are at our wits end. We can neither believe, nor pray, nor hope, nor ſubmit. We that were juſt now full, and at eaſe, and at quiet, basking our ſelves in that Sunſhine that was upon our Tabernacle, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing our ſelves, that our Mountain is made ſo ſtrong, that it ſhall never be moved.

Boaſting. It is an honour to ſuffer for Chriſt, and ſome of us cannot bear this honour, without being exalted above meaſure; we cannot be caſt down, but we are apt to be puffed up. Some of the Heathens have ſacrificed their Lives for their Countreys good; and yet not ſo much for their Countreys, as for themſelves, to purchaſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a Name and Renown. And is there no ſuch vanity to be found amongſt Chriſtians? Fear this wickedneſs, which will both ſpoil you of the comforts of your Sufferings, and loſe you your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Of a Fall.</hi> Afflictions (ſuch I mean as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall us for the Goſpel's ſake) are Temptations to Apoſtacy, and back-ſliding from Chriſt. Fear leſt the Croſs ſhould be the parting point betwixt Chriſt and your Souls; leſt it ſhould be with you, as with his Diſciples of old, who accompanied him to his Sufferings, and there forſook him and fled.</p>
                  <p>I have elſe-where ſpoken of the danger and dreadfulneſs of Apoſtacy, and ſhall therefore for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to ſpeak more of it now.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Fear the Curſe;</hi> or the Wrath and Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Vengeance of God. Luke 12.5. <hi>Fear him, which after he hath killed, hath power to caſt into Hell.</hi> Fear not Man, for he can kill but once, when he hath killed the Body, he hath done his worſt; but God can kill, and kill again; can ſmite the Body into Duſt, and the Soul into Hell. I ſay unto you, Fear him. Conſider here three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>To whom this warning was given thus to fear.</hi>
                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:103224:85"/>
And that is not to the multitude of his Hearers only, whereof there was ſo great a throng that they trod one upon another, but eſpecially to his Diſciples. <hi>He began to ſay to his Diſciples, firſt of all,</hi> v. 1. and <hi>I ſay unto you my Friends,</hi> v. 4.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>What was the ſpecial reaſon he here uſes to urge and preſs his Diſciples to fear God;</hi> and that is the Power of his Wrath, becauſe he can caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hell.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>What was the ſpecial matter of that fear he preſſes them to;</hi> and that is, leſt he that can do it, ſhould do it, ſhould actually caſt them into Hell. And this muſt be ſo, otherwiſe there had been no force in the conſideration of his Power, to work to this Fear; for they might have replyed, Though God can damn us, yet why ſhould we fear ever the more, upon that account, whilſt we are ſure he will not? And ſo his Argument from God's Power to deſtroy, had come to juſt nothing. Who would fear Damnation ever the more for that God hath power to damn him, if he were out of Fear that he would ever do it? Therefore the ſence muſt be, Fear God leſt he ſhould caſt you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hell.</p>
                  <p>Heb. 10.13. <hi>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</hi> There is an <hi>afflicting</hi> Hand of God, and there is a <hi>revenging</hi> Hand of God, and both are to be feared; even the afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hand of God is terrible. Heb. 12.5. <hi>Deſpiſe not thou the chaſtening of the Lord.</hi> Make not light of that, thou mayeſt find it heavy enough. God is terrible in his Judgments that he executeth on the Earth. He maketh the very Earth to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when his Hand is lifted up. Thoſe Hearts

are harder than the Rocks, that will not rent when God ſmites. The afflicting Hand of God is to be feared, but eſpecially, and that which is here meant, It is a fearful thing to fall into the reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hands of the living God.</p>
                  <p>Heb. 12.29. <hi>Let us have Grace, whereby we may ſerve God acceptably, with Reverence and Godly Fear; for our God is a conſuming Fire.</hi> The Lord Chriſt is ſometimes reſembled to a <hi>Refining Fire,</hi> Mal. 3.1, 2. <hi>The Lord whom ye ſeek ſhall ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come into his Temple.— But who may abide the day of his coming, and who ſhall ſtand when he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth? For he is like a Refiners Fire, — and he ſhall ſit as a Refiner and Purifier of Silver.</hi> He ſhall purifie, he ſhall ſave his People from their Sins, yet ſo as by Fire. God hath his Purgatory as well as his Hell; though not according to that Popiſh Dream, a Purgatory after this Life; Death will put an end to this purging Work in this Life; He hath his Purgatory, and his Purgatory hath its Fire; 'tis hot paſſing under the purging Work of God. But who can ſtand before him when he appeareth <hi>as a Conſuming Fire? Who can dwell with the Devouring Fire, with the Everlaſting Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings?</hi> Iſa. 33.14.</p>
                  <p>[Let us have Grace] that we may ſerve God with Fear. 'Tis not for Sinners only, but for Saints alſo, to fear the Wrath of God. Thoſe muſt, and theſe will: Grace will teach them to Fear. Hell is not ſo terrible to any, as to graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Souls; thoſe that moſt prize the Love of God, will moſt fear his Wrath. And the Lord looks it ſhould be ſo, God will not be a loſer by his Grace; he would not loſe the awe of his Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:103224:86"/>
by making us the Children of Promiſe; he would not have it forgotten that he is Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, by thoſe that have taſted that he is Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
                  <p>And the People of God have need enough, whilſt they are Children, to be kept in Fear, they are and muſt be, while they are under Age, under this ſevere Tutor. They are too apt to be proud, and wanton, and froward Children, and have need, not only of the Croſs on their Backs, but of the Curſe in their Eye, to keep them in order. How ſad is it with us, notwithſtanding all thoſe afrighting Arguments which God uſes? How foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, and peeviſh, and unruly are we, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that double recompence of Reward, the Glory to come, and the Wrath to come, that's ſet before us? O what ſhould we be, were there no ſuch Arguments to be uſed with us?</p>
                  <p>Say not <hi>'tis Mercenary</hi> to look on the Crown as the encouragement of Holineſs, till it can be ſaid, 'tis Mercenary to be governed or quickened by Love. What is it to have reſpect to the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of Reward, but ſo to eye the Love and Joy of the Lord, as to feel the Power thereof, oiling our Wheels, and drawing our Souls on after it?</p>
                  <p>Say not <hi>'tis Servile,</hi> and that which muſt not be allowed, that thoſe that are Sons ſhould make uſe of the Curſe as a bridle to Sin. This Beaſt muſt be dealt with as a Beaſt; Luſt muſt be brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and fetter'd with Fear, which will never be charmed or conſtrained by Love.</p>
                  <p>Heb. 4.1. <hi>Let us therefore fear, leſt a Promiſe being left us, of entring into his Reſt, any of you ſhould ſeem to come ſhort of it.</hi> Whilſt we take encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:103224:86"/>
from the Promiſe, the Promiſe of Entrance, let us take heed, by the fear of falling ſhort.</p>
                  <p>Is there no fear of falling ſhort? Art thou al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſo eſtabliſhed &amp; aſſured, that there's no doubt or hazard remaining of thy miſcarriage? Are all the Enemies of thy Salvation ſo ſecured, that thou mayeſt now ſpare any piece of thine Armour? Haſt thou out-grown the uſe, or the need of any of the Counſels and Caveats the Scriptures give? Look inward, ſee what a treacherous Heart thou haſt lying there, undermining thine hopes; Is there never a Worm ſtill gnawing at thy Root? Are thy Luſts all dead, and is there no doubt of their Reſurrection? Is there no guilt upon thine Head, nor guile in thine Heart? Hath neither Fleſh, nor World, nor Devil any Power in thee? Is the Army totally broken, and is there no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of its rallying upon thee? Art thou ſo fully reſolved for Holineſs? does the ſtream of thy Soul, and the bent of thy Life run ſo ſtrongly and ſo evenly after the Lord, that thou haſt a ſtanding, infallible, and uninterrupted evidence of thy Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, and an undoubted Security, for thy perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance to the end? Is there not room for ſuch a queſtion, <hi>What if I ſhould fall ſhort?</hi> Art thou gotten beyond all poſſibility of miſcarrying for ever? Friends know, that a poſſibility of falling into the Wrath to come, were that Wrath through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood, would work more fear, than a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain expectation of all the Torments and Miſeries of this Life. O Fear! Haſt thou Faith? Believe and Fear. Haſt thou Hope? Hope and Fear. Haſt thou Joy? Rejoyce with trembling. Rejoyce in

hope of the Glory of God, and tremble and fear his Wrath and Vengeance.</p>
                  <p>There will be this double uſe and advantage, (beſides others) of this fear of the Curſe.</p>

Sin is the ſting of Death, and this Death is the ſting of Sin. How bitter would Sin taſte, how gaſtly would it look, were this Gall that lies in its Belly, this ſting it carries in its Tail, diſcovered and heeded? Thou wouldſt quickly be filled with thine own wayes, didſt thou but ſee what ſtands at their further end. That Bed of Scorpions, whither Sin is dragging thee, would make every Sin as a Snake or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                  <p>And of all Sins, 'twould ſtrike the Heart with the greateſt fear <hi>of its beloved Sins.</hi> Theſe are they eſpecially, under which Hell lies in ambuſh for us; theſe are Hell's ſtrongeſt Ropes, by which it pulls in Souls. Hath any Sin caſt a Cord of Love about thee? That's it that's like to be the Rope to draw thee to the Slaughter. Thou canſt get looſe from many Sins at pleaſure, but take heed, that fooliſh Heart of thine will die for its Beloved.</p>
                  <p>If thou ask, What wouldſt thou have, O my my beloved Sin? What comeſt thou to me ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for? Why takeſt thou up thy dwelling ſo near mine Heart? It will anſwer, O 'tis to pleaſe

thee, that I am ſo often with thee. I know thou loveſt me, I am the delight of thine Heart, and the pleaſure of thine Eyes, thou canſt not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent without me.</p>
                  <p>I am that Eaſe, or that Wealth, or that Credit that thou loveſt; Is there not a league betwixt me and thee? Am not I the neareſt Friend thou haſt? Thy Health, and thy Welfare, and thy Soul, are not ſo dear as I am to thee; thou loveſt me, and therefore 'tis I come, that thou mayeſt have what thou loveſt; But what haſt thou now to ſay to it?</p>
                  <p>No, no, Traitor, 'tis my Life thou ſeekeſt, 'tis my Soul thou comeſt to ſteal away and devour. O, I dread thy fawning Face, thy ſmiles are Darts in mine Heart; I tremble at thy wooings and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces. Get thee gone Harlot, thy kindneſſes are deadly kindneſſes; What means that Dagger in thine Hand, whilſt thou thus kiſſeſt me with the kiſſes of thy Mouth? 'Tis my Death thou art deſigning, I muſt die if I will any longer love thee; and what Death muſt I die? Is it a ſhort and eaſie Death that thou art betraying me to? No, no, 'tis a bitter Death, and 'tis a lingring Death, an eternal Death that thou art preparing for me. This Heart hath been under-ground, in the dark Cavern of Pitch and Brimſtone; I have been in the Deep, and viewed thoſe Chambers of Death, where thou lodgeſt thy Lovers: I have ſent down my Spies, my thoughts have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the Belly of Hell. I have beheld how they lie in that Pit, roaring, and yelling, and blaſphem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, raving mad with the anguiſh of their burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Souls; I have ſeen the very Smoke and Fire
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:103224:88"/>
that devours them, the burning Teeth of that everlaſting Worm that gnaws their Hearts, and the fury and rage of that Serpent that deceived them in. O, my Soul quakes, my Bones trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, terror and aſtoniſhment have taken hold of me, at the Deſcription my thoughts have brought me up of that place of torment. And thou, O my beloved Sin, even thou art it that art moſt like to carry me down and bury me there. If I die that Death, 'twill be by thy hand; if I run my ſelf into that Fire, 'twill be for thy ſake. Away from me thou proud Heart, get thee gone Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, or Senſuality, or Slothfulneſs, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Name of my Beloved be; I dare not have any more to do with thee; I fear thee more than ever I loved thee; I fear where thou mayeſt lay me before tomorrow, if I ſhould ſuffer thee to lodg but one night more with me. Such dread of thy beloved Sin, would a fear of the Curſe work in thee.</p>
                  <p>Friends, conſider, Are there yet any Sins that have ſuch power over your Hearts, are your Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſo chained by them that you cannot get looſe? O, look to thoſe Chains of Fire, into which by this Chain of Love, your Sins are dragging you. Are you afraid of the Curſe of God? Are you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to burn? Are you afraid to be rack'd, and torn, and gnawn, and groun'd under the Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones of eternal Vengeance? then be afraid of Sin. Let Hell be your Fear, and Sin will be your Fear; let Sin be your Fear, and it will be no longer your Love. If you will not fear this Fear, if you will laugh at Hell, you will ſport at Sin. If you fear not to be Curſed, you will leſs fear to be
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:103224:88"/>
Wicked; if you fear not Hell, you will hardly fear to be Devils on Earth. O, Sinners, ſteep all your pleaſant Morſels in that Vinegar and Gall; ſpice all your ſtollen Waters with that Pitch and Brimſtone; ſtrow all your pleaſant wayes with thoſe Serpents and Adders, which will bite and ſting your Souls for ever. Mingle all your Carnal Delights with ſome ſuch deep thoughts of what they are betraying you to, and then go on after them without fear if you can.</p>
                  <p>And as this fear of Wrath will work a fear of Sin, ſo will it alſo work the ſame fear of <hi>tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Sin.</hi> Sin and Temptation lead the ſame way, though Temptation be one remove farther back; Temptation leads to Sin, and Sin to Death. He that fears the Fowler, will fear the ſnare of the Fowler; he that fears the Hunter, will fear his Dogs and his Toyls.</p>
                  <p>Get a fear of the Land of Darkneſs, and you will fear to be Companions of ſuch as are travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thitherward; fear the Plague, and thou wilt be no company for them, whoſe dwelling is in the Peſthouſe. Afraid of Hell, and yet never well but when thou art amongſt thoſe Decoys that are enticing thee thither!</p>
                  <p>What are the Allurements of Sinners to the Ear of him that hath Death and Wrath in his Eye? Let them entice thee, <hi>Come, Let's be merry, let's to the Alehouſe, or the Tavern, or to a Play; Let's feed to the full; let's cloth our ſelves with the beſt; let's on with the Purple and Scarlet, and fare deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly every day: Come along, caſt in thy Lot among us, What art afraid of? Cheriſh thy Fleſh, pleaſe thine Eyes and thy Humour.</hi> What will ſuch En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticements

do upon ſuch an Heart? 'Twill be all one as if they ſhould ſay, Come let's go Hang our ſelves, or Drown our ſelves, or Stab, or Poiſon our ſelves. Come, let's make our Souls over to the Devil, and write our ſelves free among the Dead; let us get us down quick into the Pit. What would thine Heart anſwer other than this? Away, O my Soul, have thou nothing to do with theſe Men, come not into their Secrets, no nor ſo much as into their Company. The like ſucceſs would all other Temptations have. He that's afraid of Paſſion, would ſhun Provocation; he that's afraid of Covetouſneſs, would be afraid of an over-buſie Life in the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>O Friends, how venturous are we! how little fear of Sin! And if there be any fear of Sin, how is it that it brings forth no more fear of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? How ſeldom do we conſider, This Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny may be a ſnare unto me, God knows with what loſs I may come off from them? This Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or this Ornament, or this Faſhion, may be a Temptation to me, my proud and vain Heart cannot bear it? this over-thrifty, or over-buſie Life, may be my undoing? this full Table, how can I allow it to my ſelf, who am given to Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite? I muſt lay a Law upon my Belly, and put a Knife to my Throat, when I ſee delicates and ſuch variety before me.</p>

The torment of the Stone, will make us forget the aking of a Tooth. Who will fear the barking of a Dog, that hears the roaring of a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi>'s living Serpent, ſwallowed up the Serpents of the Magicians, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.4, 5.

                  <p>As it is on the other ſide, The <hi>Favour of God</hi> caſts a contempt on the <hi>Flatteries of Men;</hi> the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Sun puts out all our Candles, 'tis in the night only that Gloworms ſhine. The more lively hopes of the Glory to come, darken the Glory of this preſent World; the reſpect to the recompence of Reward, makes to deſpiſe the pleaſures of Sin. What is a Comet in the day-light? What is a Cottage to him that hath a Crown in his Eye? What are Meat, and Drink, and Clothes, and Sports? what are all the blazes of theſe crackling Thorns, to the Light of the Countenance of God? Haſt thou Faith? Hath thy Faith given thee a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light? Sure thou haſt little of it, who ſtill bleſſeſt thy ſelf in the Earth. Get thee nearer the Lord, acquaint thy ſelf more with him; ſay thou unto him, Stand thou at my right hand, and thou wilt ſay to the World, ſit thou under my foot-ſtool.</p>
                  <p>Carnal Men make the World their God and their Heaven; when Riches increaſe, and Friends abound, and they are compaſſed about with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, then their Hearts are glad, and their Glory

rejoyceth. But how comes this to paſs? Alas, poor Men, this is the beſt they know, they never ſaw nor underſtood any higher things than theſe; when they arrive to a plenteous and proſperous Eſtate, they are at the top of their delight, becauſe they are come to the top of what they underſtand. The Saints have higher things in their Eye, they are gotten within ken of the Inviſible Glory, and can therefore write upon all things under the Sun, <hi>Vanity of Vanities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In like manner in the preſent caſe, As the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God will eclipſe the World's Sun-ſhine, ſo the Terrors of the Lord will make all the World's ſtorms to vaniſh away into a Miſt. The darkneſs of the Shadow will be loſt in the dark of the Night, the point of a Sword will heal the prick of a Pin.</p>
                  <p>O, what ſhall I do? The Devil is come down, and hath great wrath; the World is all in a flame againſt me; the Lions roar, the Bears and the Wolves are abroad after the Prey; I am deſpiſed, and rejected, and troden under-foot of Men; I am perſecuted and hunted up and down this Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and am become a Runnagate and a Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond in this Earth; I have loſt my Friends, loſt mine Eſtate, and they ſeek my Life alſo to take it away; O, what ſhall I do? what will become of me?</p>
                  <p>Thou art in an hard caſe indeed; but haſt thou not greater things than that to trouble thy ſelf about? How is it with thy <hi>Soul?</hi> Is not there a doubt, that the Wrath of the Almighty may be hanging over thine Head?

Look down, look down to the Serpents and Scorpions, that thy Soul is in danger of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in amongſt. Take heed, take heed, leſt the eternal God caſt thee into his Priſon, lay thee in his Irons. Let thy Soul dwell more amongſt theſe greater Fears, the Terrors of the Lord, and thou wilt not ſo much mind the Terrors of Men.

And that Impenitence, and that reprobate Mind which God gives ſome Sinners up unto, is their ſealing under the Curſe. God ſometimes curſes Sinners in this Life, as Chriſt curſed the fruitleſs Fig-tree; Mat. 21.19. <hi>Never Fruit grow on thee for ever.</hi> Be thou never good for any thing, never good Thought, never good Motion come into thee, never a drop of Dew or Rain fall upon thee, never a Bud or Bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom ſpring up in thee, nothing proſper in thee, but be thou barren for ever of every good thing; let that Soul wither, and periſh and die for ever. This Curſe is the moſt dreadful of all Curſes above-ground, and the very next to Hell.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The Curſe is pronounced in the laſt Judgment;</hi> in that terrible Sentence; Matth. 25.41. <hi>Depart from me ye Curſed, into everlaſting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> Now that, if it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Sinners may be awakened out of ſleep, and be wrought to this Fear, I ſhall a little open the Mouth of the Pit, by opening this fearful Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. <hi>[Depart from me].</hi> Depart whither? why whitherſoever it is, 'tis ſad enough that 'tis, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me,</hi> from Chriſt.

If Sinners were to be ſentenced down to this Earth again, ſent back to their Fields and Vineyards, to their Ale-houſes and Whore-houſes, to the beſt of their dirty pleaſures here below; yet this, that they are ſent into baniſhment from the Preſence and Paradiſe of God, when God ſhall ſo far open their Eyes, as to let them ſee what they have loſt, this would be an unſpeakable torment to them. But this is not their place; when they are taken hence, they ſhall return hither no more, they muſt bid an eternal farewel to all their carnal and brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh eaſe and pleaſures; their Houſes and their pleaſant Places ſhall know them no more for ever. God will not leave them ſo much as the leaſt of the left-hand Bleſſings, not a drop of Water to cool their Tongues; 'Tis into the Fire they muſt go; The pain of Fire is the moſt tormenting of all the pains we know, and therefore made uſe of to ſhadow out thoſe inexpreſſible intolerable pains, to which the ungodly ſhall be ſentenced in that day. <hi>[Everlaſting] Fire.</hi> What not yet at the bottom?

No, tis the Devil that will be with you in the fire, to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and to be tormented with you for ever. What is it to dwell in an Earthly Houſe that's haunted with the Devil?

Thoſe that tremble ſo, to ſee the Devil in their own Houſes, what will it be to them, to be carried with him into his Houſe, where he will be unclothed of all his Vizors, and no longer appear in the ſnape of a Man, no nor of a Lion or Bear, but will ſhew himſelf a Devil. <hi>[And his Angels].</hi> All the Legions of thoſe unclean and damned Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, together with all thoſe damned Souls their fellow-Sinners.

                  <p>It's true, the Lord may make his Word to Work at laſt, to convert an obſtinate Sinner, an old Sinner; He may do that by ſmall means, which greater and more likely means have not done, the laſt ſtroke may break the Flint, the laſt Arrow may cleave the Pin, the laſt Word may do the Work, when ſo many have been loſt and done nothing: But when there are ſo many Inſtances to the contrary, when it is ſo very ſeldom ſeen, wilt thou not only put thy ſelf upon ſuch a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate adventure, but remain without fear of any hazard?</p>

But who will keep me alive <hi>in this World?</hi> I muſt have Money, and Meat, and Drink, and Credit, and Friends, or elſe I am like to have but a poor Life of it here. The bleſſings of the other World will never help me to live and proſper in
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:103224:98"/>
this World; I can't feed my ſelf, nor cloth my ſelf, nor provide for my Family, with the promiſes and hopes of good things to come; and God knows, how little elſe Chriſtianity will leave me. I am like to be but a poor, hunger-bitten, melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, forſaken Soul, if I hearken to Chriſt. Away (ſaith the Fleſh) no more treaty about any ſuch thing, which doth ſo evidently tend to thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice and undoing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Inclinations of the Fleſh are againſt it.</hi> The Fleſh hangs towards Earth and Sin, and is contrary to God and Holineſs. Rom. 8.5. <hi>Thoſe that are after the Fleſh, do mind,</hi> or ſavour, <hi>the things of the Fleſh;</hi> and ſo do hang back from things Spiritual and Heavenly. What is this way of Life that Chriſt calls me to? It's quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to me, my very Nature diſguſts it, my temper and <hi>genius</hi> is againſt it. I was never acquainted with, nor accuſtomed to ſuch a way, and I cannot abide it. This preciſeneſs, and this ſcrupuloſity and tenderneſs, I have more mind to laugh at it, than ſubmit to it. It even turns my Stomach to ſee the folly of it in others, and I hate to be ſuch a fool my ſelf. I ſhould be glad of the Salvation of Chriſt, but ſure I ſhall never endure his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. I am willing to ſave what I have, and to make the beſt of what's before me: and that I am ſure Chriſt will never ſuffer me, and therefore run after him who will, he muſt have me excuſed.</p>
                  <p>Doſt thou know, O vain Man, what 'tis to ſwim againſt the Stream? and doſt thou not feel thine inward Stream running againſt Holineſs and ſerious Chriſtianity? O when art thou like to come to it? Art thou not yet afraid it may never be? eſpecially when thou conſidereſt; That,</p>

                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:103224:98"/>2. <hi>The Fleſh hath great power with thee.</hi> In Sinners, the Fleſh is the great governing Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; it bears rule in the whole Man. 'Tis their Lord and their Law, and hence they are called, <hi>the Servants of Sin,</hi> Joh. 8.34. and ſaid; <hi>to live af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Fleſh,</hi> Rom. 8.13. What-ever wickedneſs is done by them, it is the Fleſh that commands them to it. When-ever the Heart works to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, or works to Wrath, or to Pride, or to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, 'tis the Fleſh that ſets it thus on work. <hi>It is no more I that do it, but Sin that dwells in me,</hi> Rom. 7.17. And what-ever <hi>good Works</hi> are hindred, 'tis the Fleſh that hinders them. Rom. 7.19. <hi>I find a Law, that when I would do good, evil is preſent with me, ſo that the good that I would I do not.</hi> 'Tis ſaid of the Regenerate, much more true is it of Sinners. Bid a Sinner Repent, alas he cannot; bid him Pray, he cannot Pray; Bid him turn to Chriſt, and truſt in Chriſt, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him; alas, poor Man, he cannot, his Fleſh is againſt it, and hath ſuch a rule over him, that he cannot reſiſt it. The Devil rules without, and the Fleſh rules within, and who can act againſt two ſuch potent Rulers?</p>
                  <p>By the way, Sinners are in a poor caſe the while, that are under two ſuch potent Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, the Devil and Sin. How is it poſſible, O Sinners, you ſhould be ſo ſecure, when the Devil is your King, and hath ſet up that young Devil, Sin, to be his Viceroy? If you ſaw a poor Man caſt into a Den, and there committed to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody of a <hi>Lion and his Whelp;</hi> would it not pity your Heart to think, in what a caſe that poor Man were betwixt two ſuch Keepers? Sinner, Sinner, Look to thy ſelf, Behold the Lion and his Whelp;
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:103224:99"/>
thy Soul is in a more dreadful caſe, under the command of Sin and of the Devil, than thy Carcaſe would be, under the Paw of thoſe Rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Beaſts; Save thy ſelf from theſe Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>If all that the World can do, to hinder Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Converſion, will do it, they will never be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</hi> The World is againſt it, (the evil Men of the World, I here mean) they are all againſt the Converſion of Sinners.

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The Spirit of the World is againſt it.</hi> The whole World is of the ſame Spirit, which the Scribes and Phariſees are ſaid to be of, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.13. <hi>They ſhut up the Kingdom of God againſt Men, and neither will enter in themſelves, nor ſuffer thoſe that are entring to go in.</hi> They are all of another Kingdom, and thereby Parties againſt Chriſt and his Kingdom; they are for making Proſelites, but 'tis for Hell, not for Heaven.</p>
                  <p>This Spirit of the World is a Spirit of Envy and Hatred againſt Chriſt and his Followers, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.19. And this evil and envious Spirit, is that which vents it ſelf in thoſe Scoffs, Reproaches, and Perſecutions, which they let fly and raiſe againſt every Soul, that ſo much as looks after ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Chriſtianity. How full is the World of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences of this kind? No ſooner is any Soul awakened from his Sins, making out after Chriſt, and ſhewing himſelf among the Diſciples, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the Birds of Prey are picking at him; His carnal Friends, will diſſwade and diſcourage him,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:103224:99"/>
the <hi>Iſhmaels</hi> and <hi>Nimrods</hi> will be upon his back, mocking and reviling, hunting and perſecuting him. Chriſt tells us, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.10. <hi>There's joy in [Heaven] over one Sinner that repenteth;</hi> But what is there in Hell, or in the World, the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories of Hell? O they are all in a rage, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is madded, when he hath loſt a Captive, and reſolves if he will be gone, not to let him go, without ſome marks of his Fury and Rage.</p>
                  <p>Sinner, thou art yet under the Power of the Devil, &amp; it may be thou mayſt never make an offer to be gone, but wilt abide with him in quiet till he carry thee home with him to his place; But if ever thou ſhouldſt make an attempt to be gone from him, and to joyn thy ſelf to Chriſt, behold he hath a whole World of Inſtruments ready, either to block up thy way, or ſtick in thy ſides; And art thou not afraid, if it ſhould come to this, that thou ſhouldſt rather abide as thou art, than adventure on ſuch Diſcouragements?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Examples of the World are againſt it.</hi> How great is the power of Example? the whole World is much governed by Examples. Laws can do little in compariſon of what Examples can do. There is a great influence that <hi>good Examples</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten have upon Mens Minds and Manners. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt did not only <hi>make a way</hi> into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by his Blood, nor only <hi>ſhew us the way</hi> in his Doctrine, but alſo <hi>led us the way</hi> by his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. Therefore alſo the Miniſters of Chriſt are required, not only <hi>to feed the Flock</hi> by their Inſtructions, and <hi>to rule them</hi> by good Diſcipline, but to be <hi>Examples to the Flock,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.3. And therefore alſo Chriſtians are required to give a good Example to the World, and one
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:103224:100"/>
to another. 'Tis a vain thing for us to exhort one another, <hi>Be humble, be ſober, be meek, be merciful,</hi> whilſt we our ſelves are proud and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful, paſſionate and revengful; Give a good example, if you would do good by your good words; let not your Feet tread down, what your Lips build up; deſtroy not by an evil Life, what you build by good Counſel. <hi>Thou that teacheſt another ſhould not ſteal, doſt thou ſteal? Thou that ſayeſt a Man ſhould not commit Adultery, doſt thou commit Adultery?</hi> Rom. 2.21, 22. Thou that ſayeſt to another, Swear not, Lye not, give not place to Wrath, ſpeak evil of no Man, Doſt thou the ſame thing? Thou doſt more miſchief by thy evil Works, than ever thou art like to do good by thy good Speeches.</p>
                  <p>O (by the way) let us learn to bewail, and to be aſhamed of our evil Examples that we have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Ah Wretches, that ever any People ſhould be charged concerning any Profeſſors, as the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were once charged concerning the Scribes and Phariſees, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. <hi>Do as they ſay, but do not as they do.</hi> Shall this evil World have occaſion to ſpeak thus of any of the Preachers or Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, Beware of them, follow not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them; for behold, they bid Men beware of Covetouſneſs, and yet who more covetous? They bid Men beware of Pride, and yet who more proud? They charge it upon others to be juſt, to be true, to be meek, and yet who more fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, more falſe and peeviſh than themſelves? O how much miſchief do poor Sinners ſuffer by the evil Examples of ſome Profeſſors? Good Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples draw mightily, but evil Examples more. But yet the evil Examples (of Profeſſors) are not they
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:103224:100"/>
by which Sinners are in the greateſt danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kept back from Chriſt (though theſe be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious enough), but <hi>the evil Examples of the World.</hi> Sinners are of the World, and they are profeſſedly for following of the World. Now what Examples do the profane World ſet before them? whither are they leading them? Are they making towards Chriſt, and running from their Sins unto God? Does not the Stream run quite contrary? And does it not paſs for a ſufficient En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to them in their evil wayes, to think they do but as their Forefathers did before them, and as their Friends and their Neighbours do?</p>
                  <p>See how the Example of the World is urged againſt following of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 7.48, 49. <hi>Have any of the Rulers, or of the Phariſees believed on him? But this People who knoweth not the Law are curſed.</hi> What do ye mean ye fooliſh People to follow this Jeſus? Do ye ſee any of the wiſe Men, or great Men, do any of the Rulers believe on him? And will ye think your ſelves wiſer than they? Go not after him, be none of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
                  <p>And is not the ſame Argument urged upon Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners daily? Why ſhould you trouble your heads about theſe Matters? About Repentance, and Regeneration, and Conſcience, and making ſure for the other World? Do the Phariſees, and High-Prieſts, do the great Men, and the wiſe Men, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves about any ſuch Matters? It's true, there are a ſort of People which know not the Law, a company of ignorant Souls, an heady and a giddy Generation, that trouble themſelves and the World about theſe things; but what heed is to be given to them, a company of deſpicable,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:103224:101"/>
ſimple Souls? Do any of the wiſe or great Ones take this courſe?</p>
                  <p>Sinner, think with thy ſelf, what a mighty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence this ſort of Argument hath had upon thee hitherto? The World deſpiſe the Goſpel, the World neglect Chriſt: The World are for the Fleſh, for Liberty, and Care, and Pleaſures, and Idleneſs, and againſt the Spirit of Chriſtianity, the Stream runs downwards towards Sin and Hell; and hitherto thou haſt been ſwimming with the Stream, haſt gone with the Multitude, and haſt troubled thy ſelf about Chriſt and Religion as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle as any of them. O tremble to think what great danger thou art in, that thou mayeſt ſtill run down that Stream, and never ſtop till thou fall into that Gulf, from which there will be no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn or Redemption for ever.</p>
                  <p>Now Sinner, lay all theſe things together, and then judg if thou haſt not reaſon to fear thou mayeſt never eſcape the Wrath and Curſe of God. It is evident, that whilſt thou art unconverted, thou art under the Curſe; Well, but yet thou hopeſt that one time or other thou mayeſt be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; But how great fear is there thou mayeſt not? All the ungodly World are againſt thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; thine own Fleſh and the Devil are againſt it; all theſe will joyn together to hinder it if they can. And beſides all the means that have been hitherto uſed, proſper not; thou haſt been Preach'd to, thou haſt been Prayed over, thou haſt had many years of Warnings, and yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hath prevailed. And what multitudes are there that have been in thy caſe, that have ſtood it out to the laſt and died in their Sins, to here and there one that have been Converted and Saved?
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:103224:101"/>
Sure thou art in a fearful caſe, that Curſe that hangs over thee, there's but little hope but it will light upon thee, and abide upon thee for ever. O fear this Curſe, fear it in time, that if it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible thou mayeſt take warning and fly from the Wrath to come.</p>

                  <p>A fearing Chriſtian will ſearch himſelf, that he may approve himſelf to the ſearch of God's Eye, and that he may prevent the ſearch of his Hand. God's Eye is upon me every day, proving mine Heart and my Reins; I doubt he may ſee what he will not like in me: Search, O my Soul, what there is that may offend, and whether there be not ſomething in thee alſo which the Lord loveth. God's Searchers are coming abroad, and who may abide the day of their coming? Is not Poverty to be feared? Is not Sickneſs to be feared? Is not Sword, or Famine, or Fire, to be feared? O what ſharp work may theſe Searchers make upon me? Since 'tis ſo hard to endure, let me do what may be done, to prevent this kind of tryal of the Lord, by trying my ſelf.

find you to be Darkneſs, if God's Ballance ſhould find you too light? What if, whilſt you count your ſelves Children, God ſhould find you Baſtards; if whilſt you count your ſelves Vines, he ſhould find you Thorns; if while you count your ſelves Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, Beloved, and Choſen of God, that day ſhould declare you to be Infidels and Reprobates?</p>
                  <p>What if it ſhould be ſo? you are ſtark Fools, and worſe than mad, if you think ſuch a queſtion may not be put, <hi>What if I ſhould be miſtaken?</hi> Is ſuch a miſtake on which your eternal ſtate depends, of ſo little conſequence with you, as not to need ſuch a queſtion to be put about it? Are you ſo little concerned how matters ſhall go with you in the Judgment? Are you ſo little concerned what your final Sentence ſhall be? which of you for Life, and which for Death? who for Bleſſedneſs, and who for Burning? What Rocks are thoſe Hearts of yours, if they do not rent and quake for fear? And if you do fear to think, what if I ſhould be miſtaken, let that Fear ſet you a ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whether you have hitherto been miſtaken or no.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, whether you fear or no, give me leave to tell you, I am afraid concerning you. 1. Some of you, I fear there are, upon whom there hath been no good wrought, no nor any thing done to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it; not a Clod broken, not a Thorn rooted out, not a Grain of good Seed fallen upon your Hearts. Upon whom the Lord hath been plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as upon Rocks, ſowing as upon Heaths, ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering as upon Anvils, hewing as upon Iron; who with thoſe Rebels, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.4. have <hi>Brows of Graſs, and Iron Sinews;</hi> who have hitherto reſiſted
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:103224:104"/>
the Holy Ghoſt, and put from you the Word of Life; whom both the Seed and the Showers that have fallen upon you, have left hard and barren, bringing forth nothing but Briars and Thorns; In whom Oaths, and Lyes, and Drunkenneſs, and ſuch like, are all the Fruits that have been brought forth; who are far from God, and yet far from fear; whom a very little ſearch might be enough to convince you, that you are in the Gall of Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs, and the Bond of Iniquity. If you would but caſt an Eye upon God's Glaſs, your foul Faces would quickly ſhew you what you are.</p>
                  <p>O Sinners, if you your ſelves yet fear not, let others fears concerning you, thus far prevail with you, as to caſt a ſerious Eye upon your ſelves. Make a little enquiry, Is it not thus with me? Is not my Soul in this very caſe? If I ſhould ask, Where are my Sins? Behold, they compaſs me round about; they are in mine Heart, and in my Mouth, and my whole Life is filled up with Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. But if I ſhould ask, Where is my Faith? where is my Repentance? where is the new Heart and the new Life? Where is the Knowledg, and Love, and Life, and Fear of God? What could I ſay, what anſwer could I give? Make a little enquiry thus; a very little, to a Man in thy caſe, me-thinks ſhould be enough to convince and awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thee.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Others of you I fear there maybe, upon whom the Lord hath been at work, but the Work is not yet brought thorow. Upon whom though the Plough hath entred and made ſome ſign, yet it hath not gone deep enough; though the Thorns, ſome of them, are cut down, yet their Root re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth;
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:103224:105"/>
though the Seed of God hath fallen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, and ſome Blades have ſprung up, yet it hath taken no root; upon whom though there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſome dawning towards the Day, yet you are not come to Sun-riſing.</p>
                  <p>As for you, it is a mercy that there is ſomething done, eſpecially if there be ſtill more a-doing. It is a mercy that the Lord hath made a motion of Love to you, and that he is not totally rejected; that there is a Treaty for Peace, whereof you have ſo far accepted, as to yield to a Ceſſation of Arms, and a forbearance of thoſe open Acts of Hoſtility againſt God which have been; that the Drunkards are become ſober, that the Swearers now fear an Oath; that the Enemies of God, and of all Righteouſneſs, are now content to hear of a Reconciliation. This is a mercy.</p>
                  <p>Much more, That any of you are ſo far convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the miſery of Sin, of the excellency and neceſſity of Religion and Godlineſs, that you are wrought to ſome good liking of the Holy Wayes of God, and are wiſhing, and waiting, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out after the Lord. This is a Mercy, becauſe there is hope, that he that hath brought you hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, will bring you on farther and farther till he hath brought you home. But yet there is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great fear too, leſt preſuming you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready attained, you ſhould ſit down ſhort of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-Grace, and ſo periſh at laſt.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>From the Self-evidencing Light of the Doctrine of Godlineſs.</hi> The Doctrine of Chriſtianity proves it ſelf to be of God, by that Divine Light that ſhines forth in it, there is a ſtamp of Divinity imprinted upon it. Is God an Holy God? So is this Doctrine an Holy Doctrine. Is God a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful and Gracious God? So is this Doctrine, a Doctrine of Mercy, a Doctrine of Grace; there is Grace and Mercy runs through the whole Body of it; nay, they are the very Soul and Life of it. Is God a God of Wiſdom? The Doctrine of Chriſtianity is the Wiſdom of God in a Myſtery. Is God a God of Truth and of Righteouſneſs?
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:103224:106"/>
Such is the Doctrine of the Goſpel; that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is according to Truth, and reveals the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God, but requires Truth and impoſes Righteouſneſs upon all that will embrace it. What is more contrary to this Word of Truth than a Lye, or than Hypocriſie and Guile? What is more contrary to this Word of Righteouſneſs than Unrighteouſneſs? Doth the Word of the Goſpel allow any Iniquity? Is there any guile found in it, or any toleration whereof in its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors? Doth it not command all Righteouſneſs, and condemn all Unrighteouſneſs? even while it juſtifies the Sinner, it condemns the Sin. This Religion is <hi>pure Religion, and undefiled before God,</hi> Jam. 1.25. <hi>Teaching us, that denying all ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and worldly Luſts, we ſhould live righteouſly, ſoberly, and godly in this preſent World,</hi> Tit. 2.13, 14. Now he that knows that God is an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Wiſe God, a God of Grace, of Truth, and of Righteouſneſs, and does but underſtand the Scriptures, may, without any great difficulty, be led into a good opinion of that Godlineſs which is there held forth and required.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>From the Convincing Lives of the Sincere Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Chriſtianity.</hi> I do not ſay, from the Lives of all Profeſſors; ſome Profeſſors of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity there are, who are not Chriſtians. Some ſuch there are amongſt Profeſſors, who are diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly walkers, whoſe Wayes are ſo evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their Profeſſion, as if the Devil had led them into their Chriſtianity, on purpoſe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace the Goſpel; and 'tis like enough, 'twas his doing indeed, to make Profeſſors of them. This Tempter may tempt Men into Religion, as far as
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:103224:107"/>
may ſewe his own ends, and Mens Luſts may make them Diſciples. Such, I mean, who while they pretend to the Spirit, do walk after the Fleſh, who <hi>hold the Truth in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 1.18. who are proud, ſelf-conceited, ſelf-willed, heady, giddy, wandring and unſtable Souls; like crooked Lines, that in ſome points touch with the Rule, but for the moſt part do ſwerve from it, on this hand and on that. Who are ſcrupulous about ſome ſmaller Matters, which they fancy to have an appearance of evil, and yet allow themſelves in apparent Evils, ſtraining at a Gnat, and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing a Camel, inſiſting much on ſome Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and neglecting the weightier Matters of the Law, like thoſe <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.23, 24.</p>
                  <p>'Tis but little that Godlineſs is beholden for the good Opinion it hath obtained to ſuch as theſe; But to the <hi>ſincere and ſingle-hearted Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors,</hi> whoſe Lives are a Copy or Pattern of wholſom Doctrine, holding forth the Word of Life, exemplifying the Holy Rules laid down in Scripture, and ſhewing forth the Vertues of Chriſt before the World. Who are in the World, as he was in the World; who live by Faith, and walk in Love, being humble, meek, peaceable, merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, temperate, true, righteous and holy, in all manner of Converſation. Theſe are the Perſons whoſe Lives do commend Godlineſs to the World; and force their very Hearts, many of them, to acknowledg: Sure this is the Way of God that theſe Men walk; it cannot be but God is in them of a very truth; ſure theſe are the Servants of the Living God, this is Religion indeed; if there be any way of Life this is the way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="205" facs="tcp:103224:107"/>It's true, this way is every-where ſpoken againſt by the malicious, but the more like to be of God for that; So 'twas in the Apoſtles dayes, <hi>Acts</hi> 28.22. <hi>As for this Sect, we know it is every-where ſpoken againſt:</hi> Mark it, Chriſtianity was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the malicious but a Sect or a Faction, and Chriſtians but Sectaries; ſo they were counted and called, about 1600 years ago, and therefore 'tis no diſparagement if they be counted ſo ſtill.</p>
                  <p>But ſayes the conſidering Sinner, let them be called what Men pleaſe, Sectaries, Seducers, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, or what elſe malice can invent; yet as it was ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 10.21. <hi>Theſe are not the words of him that hath a Devil;</hi> ſo it may be ſaid of his Followers, Call them what you will, yet theſe are not the Lives of Schiſmaticks or Hypocrites, theſe Men are the Servants of the moſt High God, and their way is the way of Life.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>From the Self-condemnation that all other wayes carry in them.</hi> If this be not the way of Life, there's none; if theſe be not the Servants of God, there are none ſuch in the World. For where are they elſe to be found? Are the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and the Earthly, and the Irreligious, are theſe the Religious? Are the Carnal, and the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, and the out-ſide Worſhippers, that will give Chriſt the Cap and the Knee, and yet can Drink, and Riot, and Swear, and Scoff, are theſe the ſincere Worſhippers of God? This muſt be the Good Way, or which elſe can it, with any tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable probability, be imagined to be? Surely if this be not it, we muſt even all count to be damn'd,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:103224:108"/>
for there is no other, that ſo much as looks like the Path of Life.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Atheiſt</hi> muſt ſay, I am not in the way to God, this Fool hath ſaid in his Heart, There is no God.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> with his Doctrine muſt ſay, I am not the Way, I am Antichriſt, 'tis Chriſt only that brings us to God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Formality</hi> muſt ſay, I am not the Way, for <hi>God is a Spirit, and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in Spirit and in Truth,</hi> John 4.24.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Profaneneſs</hi> muſt ſay, I am not the Way to God, I am the Way of Death, and my ſteps lead down to Hell. If there be any Way of Death in the World, profaneneſs is it.</p>
                  <p>Drunkards, and Swearers, and Revellers, and Rioters, if their Conſciences may but have the priviledg of their Tongues, will tell you, we are all out of the Way, we muſt take another courſe than the Devil and our Luſts will yet ſuffer us, or elſe wo to us that ever we were born; We would be loth to die in the Way we live in, we muſt turn a new Leaf or we are undone. Theſe do not ſo much as pretend to be in the Way of Life.</p>
                  <p>Well, thus far now a Sinner may come; by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the Self-evidencing Light that is in the Doctrine of Godlineſs, the convincing Lives of the Sincere Profeſſors thereof, the Self-condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is in all other Wayes, he may be led into a good Opinion of Sincere-Godlineſs. And this Good Opinion is but a little ground gotten to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, It is not Godlineſs to think well of it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Sinners good Opinion of Godlineſs, may beget good Inclinations towards it, and good wiſhes after
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:103224:108"/>
it.</hi> Happy are thoſe Souls that are in Chriſt, who walk not after the Fleſh but after the Spirit; O that my Soul were among them, I could even find in mine Heart to be one of his Diſciples. I am in a ſtrait between two, (as the Apoſtle ſaid in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.21.) and what I ſhall chuſe I wot not; fain I would be a Chriſtian in earneſt, I ſee it would be beſt for me to be ſo, and O that I were! But on the other ſide, how ſhall I bear the Labours and Sufferings of that way? What ſhall I do? what ſhall I chuſe? I would be a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Chriſt, but I am afraid what may come of it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Sinners good Opinions and good Inclinations, may bring forth ſome ineffectual Attempts and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours;</hi> they may ſet forth after Chriſt; their enlightned Minds may ſet their Hearts upon them, and cauſe them to fall a reaſoning thus with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; If this be the good way, why ſhould not I walk in it? Is a Godly Life ſuch an Excellent Life? can I approve it in others? can I pronounce them bleſſed who ſo live? Come, my Soul, put in for a part in Chriſt, reſolve once what thou wilt do, ſtay not in theſe Uncertainties, hang no longer betwixt Heaven and Hell; ſpeak the word once, Wilt thou be for Chriſt? Shall the Sincere Chriſtians God be my God, their Hopes my Hopes, their Life my Life? Shall I caſt in my Lot among them, and take up my Lot with theirs? Come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, venture after the Lamb, venture for the Bleſſedneſs to come; ſet to Praying, ſet to Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, give thy ſelf to the ſtudy and practice of that bleſſed courſe which thou knoweſt will have its Fruit unto Holineſs, and its end Everlaſting
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:103224:109"/>
Life. And yet after all this, little or nothing may be done.</p>
                  <p>Theſe now are fair Preparations to Grace, but this is not Grace. Conviction is not Converſion; the approving, and liking, and wiſhing for, and making ſome ineffectual Attempts and Offers at Godlineſs, this is not chuſing and embracing it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>There are Images of Grace, which are not Grace.</hi> There is a form of Godlineſs which is not Godlineſs, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. An Image is not the ſame, an Image of a Man is not a Man, the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of a Chriſtian is not a Chriſtian. The Image of Chriſt is a Chriſtian, but the Image of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is no Chriſtian; as great a likeneſs as there is, yet there is as great a difference alſo as betwixt Living and Dead.</p>
                  <p>There is ſomething like Faith which is not Faith, ſomething like Repentance which is not Repentance; ſomething like the New Man, and is not it, but the Old Man new dreſſed up; and ſo like it may be, in Complexion, in Language, in Carriage, that it is often taken to be the ſame. The Pangs of Travel may bring forth, but when all comes to all, it may be but a dead Child; there may be all the Parts, the Head, the Eyes, the Hands, and every Limb, but no Life; and yet when it is but newly brought forth, it may be hard to diſcern whether it be alive or dead; ſo difficult is it to diſcern between Common and Special Grace; ſo many Counterfeits have there been found, which have both been Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and deceived, as is enough to make the Hearts of many Chriſtians indeed to ſhake.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="209" facs="tcp:103224:109"/>3. <hi>There are ſome Properties of Gracious Perſons, which are no certain Evidences of Grace; but may be found alſo in Hypocrites.</hi> Nothing can evidence the Truth of Grace, but that which is ſo adae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quately proper to Saints, that it cannot be found in an Hypocrite. What-ever maybe found in an Hypocrite, can never certainly prove me to be no Hypocrite. <hi>Aſſuring</hi> Marks muſt be diſtiguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Marks, ſuch as ſeparate betwixt the Precious and the Vile; and nothing can diſtinguiſh the Sound from the Unſound, but that which the Unſound cannot attain. As 'tis ſaid of ſome Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.5. <hi>Their Spot is not the Spot of his Children;</hi> So may it be ſaid of all Saints, Their Grace is not the Grace of his Enemies; and we can never come to give a clear and comfortable Judgment of our ſelves, till we find ſomething in us, which is not to be found in any Hypocrites in the World.</p>
                  <p>But ſome Properties there are of Sincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, which may be found in Hypocrites; which yet ſome Divines have ſome-what unwarily made uſe of, and propoſed for Peoples Tryal of their States.</p>
                  <p>Indeed it is much to be wiſhed, that we were more exact and cautelous in this Matter, than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of us are at this day. Though good uſe may be made of probable. Evidences, yet ſhould we declare to our People, which are but probable Marks, and which are certainly concluding. Of thoſe Properties of Chriſtians, which ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines have formerly given as Marks of Sincerity, I ſhall mention three;

to ſee ſome ſee Men from Perſecutors to become Pofeſſors of Religion; theſe things are a good fight, but they are no ſure ſign of Sincerity. Men may Pray, and Hear, and be much reformed in their Lives, and yet be ſhort of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The neglect of Prayer and Hearing, and the going on in a courſe of Sin, are certain ſigns of a wicked Man; Thou that prayeſt not, and wilt not receive Inſtruction, and hateſt to be reformed, art thou a Saint? Thy groſs neglects, and thy evil doings, are Satan's Marks upon thee. Art thou ſtill going on in thy wickedneſs? How canſt thou ſay or think but that thou art of the wicked One? Yet the performance of theſe Duties, Praying, Hearing, and ſomewhat of Reformation, are no certain ſigns that thou art of God.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>total</hi> and thorough Reformation, a withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves from every evil way, a reſigning up our ſelves to the Government of Chriſt, and the Conduct of the Spirit, and an actual care and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to walk uprightly according to the Truth of the Goſpel, is the beſt and laſt proof of our Sincerity. But much Reformation there may be in the Life, and yet the Heart not right with God.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, while we are comforted over you, and rejoyce that there is ſo much done upon many of you, as there is, that there are ſo many Praying Ones among you, who were wont to neglect Prayer; that there are ſo many of you to be found at a Sermon, who were once more like to have been found in an Alehouſe, (bleſſed be God that there is ſuch viſible Reformation among you, both of your Perſons and Families). Beſides thoſe of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:103224:111"/>
you that have given a good proof of an inward Saving-change, even this that appears upon others of you, is a comfort to us; Yet beware how you venture your Souls upon this, though hopeful, yet I doubt but partial Reformation; and all this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, fear leſt you ſhould, and look dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently that you do not fall ſhort of the Grace of God at laſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>There is no one Grace that is really ſo, if it be alone, that will put us out of doubt concerning our ſtate.</hi> There is no one Mark by which we can give a certain judgment of our ſelves, without the concurrent teſtimony of other Marks with it. The Graces of God in us, muſt give mutual teſtimony each to other, before any of them can give clear teſtimony to us. Our Love muſt prove our Faith to be ſincere, our Holy Obedience muſt prove our Love to be ſincere, before either our Faith or Love will prove either themſelves or us to be ſo. If I have the very Faith of God's Elect, and I yet que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion whether I love or no; If I feel I love, and cannot prove 'tis in ſincerity by my Obedience, neither the one nor the other will give me confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence before God. One Grace wanting, will be an Objection againſt thoſe that appear. I believe, but ſure I fear, 'tis not with Faith unfeigned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I cannot find I love, and ſo in the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Not but that any one Saving-Grace, where-ever it is found to be ſuch, is an infallible Evidence of Sincerity; But ſtill the doubt will be, whether this Grace I find, be Grace indeed; and unleſs it be witneſſed, by the concurrence of other Graces, that doubt is never like, in an ordinary way, to be clearly reſolved. Therefore that Exhortation
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:103224:111"/>
of the Apoſtle, <hi>Add to your Faith Vertue, and to Vertue Knowledg, and to Knowledg Temperance,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Pet. 1.5, 6. is neceſſarily to be minded, in order to the obtaining that Aſſurance which the Apoſtle in the following Verſes, directs and exhorts with diligence to follow after.</p>

Let us a little conſider that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.33, 34, 35. <hi>When the unclean Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is gone out of a Man, he walketh through dry pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſeeking reſt and findeth none; then he ſaith, I will return into my Houſe from whence I came forth; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, ſwept, and garniſhed; then goeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  <p>[When the unclean Spirit goeth out of a Man.] That Sinners are ſo vile and abominable, it is from that wicked Spirit, Satan, that dwells in them. Every Sinner is a poſſeſſed Perſon, poſſeſſed of a Devil. When they are a little reformed, they ſeem for the time to be diſpoſſeſſed; but there is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the Devil's <hi>going out,</hi> and his being <hi>caſt out:</hi> Satan may a little with-draw from Souls, as to the <hi>Impetus</hi> or violence of his Suggeſtions and Operations, whilſt ſtill he holds his Dominion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="214" facs="tcp:103224:112"/>[He walketh through dry places]. What theſe dry places may be, is not ſo eaſie to determine; ſome by theſe <hi>loca arida,</hi> underſtand <hi>loca v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>na,</hi> void and empty places, the Deſarts and Waſtes of the Earth, where he finds no Body to tempt or moleſt. But could Satan think to find reſt there, where was no Houſe for him to lay his Head in? Would the Tempter waſt time in ſeeking whom to devour in thoſe waſt places, where he knew wel enough there were none to be found? he knows too well where Sinners dwell, to go to ſeek them where they are not; more like to find the Devil in a Market, than in a Wilderneſs. This therefore ſeems not to be the ſence.</p>
                  <p>May I give my conjecture? Why may not theſe dry places be the Saints on Earth, the Fountain of whoſe Blood is dryed up? in whom the Sun hath dryed up their Dirt and Mire, in which this Swine loves to wallow. Satan may have his Walks through the beſt of Men, but theſe are no Habitation for him. The Devil, with the Swine, hath his Habitation in the filthy places, in the Mud and Mire; or with the <hi>Behemoth,</hi> of whom 'tis ſaid, <hi>Job</hi> 40.21. <hi>He lyeth under the ſhady Trees, under the covert of the Reeds in the Fens.</hi> He loves to be in the Shade, where no Sun comes to diſturb him; in the Moors and in the Fens, where he may have Mire enough to tumble in. Miry moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Hearts, dirty Fenniſh Souls, are the Dens of Devils; the Saints in compariſon of theſe are dry places.</p>
                  <p>[He ſeeketh reſt]. This notes two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>When the Devil is gone out of any Perſon, he is never at reſt till he is gotten in again, either thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:103224:112"/>
whence he went out, or into ſome other Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion where he may do miſchief.</hi> Like Children, like Father; as 'tis ſaid of them, ſo 'tis much more true of him, he reſts not but in doing miſchief.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Devil loves to dwell where he may be at reſt.</hi> That is, not from Work (his Work is his reſt) but from Reſiſtance or Oppoſition. In carnal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Hearts, the unclean Spirit may be at reſt; there's nothing to diſturb or give him diſquiet. He may dwell at eaſe, and rule and domineer at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Nay if he pleaſe he may be at reſt, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from Oppoſition, but from Work too; he may take up ſuch Habitations for his Houſes <hi>to ſleep in,</hi> his Work goes on whether he wakes or ſleeps. Wicked Hearts do the Devil's Work to his hand, he may ſave himſelf much of his labour, they will run on to Death and Hell, without the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils driving them.</p>
                  <p>Fooliſh Sinners are apt to think themſelves ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from the Devil, they live in I conſtant calm, and find no ſuch buffetings and bluſterings of the Devil upon them, as ſome of the Saints do, but are in quiet and at peace, and thereupon are confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent there's no Devil near them.</p>
                  <p>But ſtay Friends, not ſo confident; caſt an eye upon <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.21. there you may read, <hi>When a ſtrong Man armed keepeth the Houſe, his Goods are in peace.</hi> It is not becauſe the Devil is not near you, that you hear no more of him, but becauſe he hath you ſure enough, and needs not keep a ſtir to make you ſurer. Do but offer to depart and make an eſcape, give but a ſhake at his Yoke to get it off, and get you away towards Chriſt, and then you ſhall find whether the Devil be at hand
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:103224:113"/>
or no. He is at reſt in thee, Sinner, and that's the reaſon, thou heareſt no news nor noiſe of him; he hath thee ſafe enough, or elſe thou ſhouldſt be ſure to find, he were not far off from thee.</p>
                  <p>[Seeking reſt and findeth none]. He goes through theſe dry places, from Saint to Saint, from Heart to Heart, in hope to find entertainment, but is ſtill diſappointed. Here's little reſt for me to be had; theſe dry places, I ſee, are no place for me; Here's ſuch watching, and wreſtling, and warring againſt me, ſuch jealouſes and ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of me; ſo much praying and complaining a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, that thre's no ſtay for me here.</p>
                  <p>This, whether it be the Truth of the Text or no, I will not peremptorily determine; but a certain Truth it is, The Devil ſeeks entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Saints, but cannot find to his mind.</p>
                  <p>[Then he ſaith, I will return to mine Houſe from whence I came out]. Well, I ſee, there's no hope of reſt for me here, but I know whither I may go, and be welcome, I'le back to my old Habitation.</p>
                  <p>[And when he is come, he findeth it empty, ſwept, and garniſhed]. A little cleaner and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former than when he left it, the Devil can allow Sinners a little Reformation. But though it be a little cleaned and garniſhed, yet it lies empty ſtill; there's no other Tenant hath taken it up, though the Devil went out, yet Chriſt was not let in, but there it lies void for the next that comes.</p>
                  <p>[Then goeth he and taketh ſeven other Spirits more wicked than himſelf, and they enter in, and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:103224:113"/>
dwell there, and the laſt ſtate of that Man is worſe than his firſt]. Beware of a returning Devil; the Devil at his return, often makes ſeven-ſold worſe work than before he did.</p>
                  <p>Friends, it may be there be ſome among you, in whom the unclean Spirit hath been ruling and ſpurring, and riding you poſt on, upon all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of wickedneſs; Drunkenneſs, Whoredom, Swearing, Curſing, and all manner of Abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; But at preſent it may be, he is for a ſeaſon departed, and hath a little with-drawn from you; and now you are grown more ſober, and temperate, and chaſt; much reformed of what you once were; you are ſwept and garniſhed; you have laid by your former profaneneſs, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up the Profeſſion of Religion, and put on a Form of Godlineſs; there is a better face upon you, and upon your wayes; and now you think all's well, you are become new Men, and your ſtate is happy.</p>
                  <p>But do you not ſtand empty ſtill? Hath Chriſt taken up theſe Hearts, for his own Habitation? If the Unclean Spirit be gone out, is the Holy Spirit come in? How much ſoever you are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, of what you have been, are you tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the renewing of your Mind? Are you not only garniſhed with common Grace, but are you furniſhed with ſpecial Grace? Is Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you? If not, O take heed, the Devil may come about again, and make his re-entry upon you, and then you have not been ſo wicked hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but you may become ſeven times more vile, and your latter end may be worſe than your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="218" facs="tcp:103224:114"/>Beloved, I hope and am perſwaded, that there are divers among you, from whom, through the abundant Grace of God towards you, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Spirit is not only withdrawn, but caſt out; that you are not only a little overly ſwept and garniſhed, but eſtabliſhed in the Grace of God. I hope and believe, that there are many here in whom the Holy Spirit hath gotten ſuch footing, that the Devil ſhall never come in again, to ſet up his Throne, or take up his Reſt in you; But yet I warn you, eſpecially the younger Profeſſors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, to maintain a Godly Jealouſie of your ſelves, and to fear how it may be with you.</p>
                  <p>Now Friends, conſider what hath been ſaid; Are there Preparations for Grace which yet are no Grace? Are there Images of Grace, which yet are no Grace? And may they be ſo well like, that they are often taken to be the ſame? May you have many Properties of Sincere Chriſtians, and yet be no Chriſtians? May all you have of them, go back, and come to worſe than nothing? Believe this, and ſee if it work not fear in you.</p>

And until the matter be brought to this iſſue, that there is ſomething found, ſuch a Faith, ſuch a Love, ſuch Holy Obedience, as cannot be found in Hypocrites; till then, this Fear (which will ever ſuſpect the worſt) will nor give over, but ſtill will come on, with queſtion upon queſtion.

                     <p>To the firſt Inquiry, I ſhall give in the anſwer from Scripture and Reaſon.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>From Scripture;</hi> This is the choice that the Scripture Saints, have been recorded to have made. This was <hi>Moſes</hi> his choice, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.25, 26. <hi>Chooſing rather to ſuffer afflictions with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleaſures of Sin.—For he had reſpect to the recompence of reward.</hi> This was <hi>David</hi>'s choice, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.2.5. <hi>O my ſoul, thou haſt ſaid unto the Lord, thou art my Lord. The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance.</hi> This was <hi>Aſaph</hi>'s choice, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25, 26. <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee, and there is none upon Earth that I deſire beſides thee.—God is the ſtrength of mine heart, and my portion for ever.</hi> This was <hi>Mary</hi>'s choice, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.42. <hi>Mary hath choſen
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:103224:119"/>
the good part which ſhall never be taken from her.</hi> There are but two parts, one of which every one chooſes; the good part, and the evil part. The good part is God, and things above; <hi>there is none good but one, that is God;</hi> and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing good, but one thing, the grace and good will of God; the evil part, are all things below: All the good things of the world, are the evil part; a good Eſtate, a good Name, a good Houſe, good Friends, though they be good in their kind, yet are an evil portion, and he whoſe portion they are, is an evil man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.4. <hi>Mary</hi> was a good Woman, and 'tis evident ſhe was ſo, for ſhe made a good choice: ſhe choſe the good part, which ſhall never be taken from her.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>From Reaſon.</hi> There are two things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in this choice of God, that are infallible evidences of a godly man. Our chooſing of God for our happineſs, includes in it,</p>
                     <lg>
                        <l>Our preferring of God above all things.</l>
                        <l>Our being made like unto God.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Our preferring of God above all things.</hi> Every man will chooſe the beſt; that is, that which he judges beſt, and loves beſt. The reaſon of mens choice is, their liking that which they chooſe, better than that which they refuſe. He that neglecting God, chooſes this world for his portion, therein takes the Crown off the head of the Lord, and ſets it upon the world, and ſayes of it, this is better for me, then God; he that neglecting the world, chooſes
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:103224:119"/>
God for his portion, therein ſayes, God is better than all.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Our chooſing of God for our happineſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers our being made like unto God.</hi> Every man chooſes for himſelf, according to his own heart. 'Tis the heart that makes the choice, and it choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that which is moſt ſuitable to it. The heart that chooſes God, 'tis a ſign, both that it likes God beſt, and is made like unto God.</p>
                     <p>As by mens particular choices, here below, you may judge what ſpirit they are of; he that choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the pleaſures of the fleſh, ſhews himſelf to be of a ſenſual heart; he that chooſes riches, ſhews himſelf to be of a covetous heart; he that choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the honours and pomps of the world, ſhews himſelf to be of a proud heart; ſo in mens gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral choice, he that chooſes for himſelf here below, proves himſelf a worldly-minded man, and he that chooſes for himſelf above, therein appears to be of an Heavenly mind. He that hath choſen God, 'tis a ſign that he is made like unto God, 'tis divine grace in the heart, that hath made the choice.</p>
                     <p>There's one of theſe two ruling powers in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heart, <hi>Nature or Grace,</hi> and look which of the two hath the rule, 'tis that which hath the caſting voice, in the choice that's made; and each of theſe, do chooſe what's ſuitable to them. Corrupt nature chooſes what's ſuitable to it, and finding nothing in God, nor in all the world to come, that will pleaſe it, it chooſes for it ſelf below; And a gracious heart chooſes what's moſt ſuitable to it; and finding as little to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent it in this world, as a carnal heart doth in
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:103224:120"/>
Heaven, therefore gets it up, and takes its lot above. Nothing will content grace, but God and Glory, and nothing but grace, can be content with God alone. The heart of man will never be carried up to Heaven, to pitch there, till there be ſomething of Heaven, firſt let down into it, to fetch it up.</p>
                     <p>Now, he that prefers God above all, and is made like unto God, is certainly a godly man; and thus the firſt enquiry is anſwered. It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that he that hath choſen God is a godly man, for this is lay'd down, as a ſpecial chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of the Saints in Scripture, and in this choice of God, is included, our preferring God above all, and one being made like unto him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>How may I know that I have ſincerely choſen God?</hi> Here lyes the main doubt to be reſolved. There be many that ſay, God is my portion, I have choſen him for my inheritance, and they think as they ſpeak, and yet do but deceive themſelves; I hope I have ſincerely choſen the Lord, but yet am in fear, leſt I alſo may be deceived. How may I know whether it be ſo or no? To this I anſwer, you may know that you have ſincerely choſen the Lord,

                           <item>2. <hi>If you have choſen him abſolutely.</hi>

                        <pb n="261" facs="tcp:103224:120"/>1. <hi>If you have choſen God deliberately;</hi> if your choice be not in a ſudden fit, but be the reſult of the deepeſt conſideration. Suddain bargains are often, as ſuddenly repented of. A light unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed choice, is not like to hold, and while it holds, there's no great heed to be given to it. Some men are ſuch unſtable Souls, that their whole life almoſt, is nothing elſe but chooſing and changing, when we chooſe underſtandingly, and deliberately, when we have throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the great reaſons for our chooſing God, <hi>his worthineſs and excellency, and our own neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> and have alſo weighed all the inconveniencies thereof, and all the objections againſt it, and do find, that the reaſons for, do infinitely over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballance all that can be ſaid againſt it, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon determine for God, that's like to be found a ſincere choice.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>If you have choſen him abſolutely,</hi> as that which you will ſtand to, to the laſt, whatever inconveniencies may follow. When there are no ifs nor ands, no reſerves in your heart, nor place leſt for repentance. When your choice runs not, as <hi>Jacob</hi>'s conditional vow, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.20. <hi>If the Lord will be with me, and will keep me in the way that I go, and give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, ſo that I return to my Fathers houſe in peace, [then] the Lord ſhall be my God;</hi> but without any ſuch if's, whether he will feed me or no, cloth me or no, let him do with me as he will for that, I am reſolved however, the Lord ſhall be my God.</p>
                     <p>And indeed, ſo was <hi>Jacob</hi> too, however the words ſound. This was never intended by him,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:103224:121"/>
as the condition of his Religion, (there's no other condition of that, but if, or ſince the Lord will be my God, he ſhall be my God) <hi>Jacob</hi> was in bond to God before, and here he enters into a new bond, layes a new obligation upon himſelf, every one of theſe Mercies, ſhall be ſo many new cords, to bind me faſt to the Lord; but whether theſe new cords were added or no, whether the Lord would keep, or feed, or cloth him, or no, 'twas never his intent, but his old bond ſhould ſtand however, that the Lord ſhould be his God.</p>
                     <p>And as there are no reſerves, nor conditions in this our choice of God, ſo is there a reſolution againſt repenting of our choice, whatever ſhould happen. A Chriſtian chooſes once for all, choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and changes not. His choice of God is like to Gods choice, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.4. <hi>I have ſworn and will not repent,</hi> ſayes he, concerning Chriſt. <hi>The gifts and calling of God,</hi> much more the Election of God, <hi>are without repentance,</hi> Rom. 11.29. where we chooſe God abſolutely, we leave no place for repentance.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>If you carefully purſue your choice.</hi> Thus was it with <hi>Paul,</hi> who had choſen for himſelf above, and taken his aim at the right mark, <hi>the prize of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> he ſayes, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.12, 13. <hi>I follow after, I reach forward, I preſs to the mark.</hi> Some vain men perſwade themſelves, that they have choſen God, and yet ſeldom or never look after, nor take any care to obtain, and make ſure of him whom they have choſen; they chooſe God, but never follow God, nor take the way that leads to the bleſſedneſs to come. Sincere choice, takes
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:103224:121"/>
in both end and means. When the choice of our hearts doth govern the courſe of our lives, and doth effectually bend our courſe towards the obtaining of him, whom we have choſen; when this becomes our main drift and ſcope; This I pray for, this I wait for, this I labour for, this I live for; I have nothing elſe to do, but to ſerve and make ſure of God; if I can but ſo live, as to pleaſe God here, and get to Heaven when I dye, whatever I miſcarry in, 'tis all I look for; this argues ſuch a choice of God, as will certainly argue us to be of God. To chooſe God, and yet to live to our ſelves, to chooſe Heaven for our portion, and yet to have our converſation in the earth; an idle and inefficacious choice, that doth not effectually command us after him, whom we have choſen, but let us run our old carnal courſe, is a vanity and a deluſion.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>If you meaſure your [preſent] happineſs, by the communications of God to you, and the clearneſs of your title to him.</hi> He that hath choſen God for his happineſs, look how much he poſſeſſes, and enjoys of God, and to what degree of clearneſs he is come, concerning his Evidences for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to ſuch a degree of happineſs, he counts himſelf to have arrived; whilſt he can love, and pleaſe, and ſerve the Lord, and maintain a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of his acceptance with him, ſo long he can rejoyce; when he is eſtranged from God, he is as a man undone. Therefore is it, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſet themſelves to get as much of God here, and as ſure a claim to the inheritance of the Saints in light, as poſſibly they can. Every one would make as ſure of happineſs as he can, and would
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:103224:122"/>
be happy as ſoon as he can, would get, as much as may be, into preſent poſſeſſion.</p>
                     <p>Hence are thoſe breathings, and thirſtings, and rejoycings of the Saints, which we read of in Scripture. <hi>As the hart panteth after the water brooks, ſo panteth my Soul after thee O God; my Soul thirſteth for God, for the living God,</hi> Pſal. 42.1, 2. <hi>My Soul thirſteth for thee, my Fleſh longeth for thee—thy loving kindneſs is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than life—My Soul ſhall be ſatisfied as with marrow and fatneſs, when my mouth ſhall praiſe thee with joyful lips,</hi> Pſal. 63. <hi>O that my wayes were ſo directed, to keep thy Statutes. O let me not wander from thy Commandments,</hi> Pſal. 119.5.10. <hi>For in keeping them is great reward,</hi> Pſal. 19. <hi>I have ſet the Lord alwayes before me, becauſe he is at my right hand, I ſhall not be moved; therefore mine heart is glad, and my glory rejoyceth,</hi> Pſal. 16.8, 9. <hi>Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon me; thou haſt put gladneſs in my heart,</hi> Pſal. 4.6, 7.</p>
                     <p>Chriſtians can never have good dayes, longer than they are walking with God, and beholding his face in righteouſneſs; this is their Heaven on Earth. The reflection of the face of God, in his Holy Image, that appears upon them; the irradiations of his Holy Spirit, and the light of his countenance, whileſt they are walking in the Law of the Lord; the proſpering of their Souls in the grace of God, and the comforts of the Holy Ghoſt, this is the ſunſhine of their lives. Their countenance is fallen, their heart is ſick, they reckon themſelves among the dead, when God and their Souls are parted. He hath no
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:103224:122"/>
part in God, that can live comfortably without him.</p>
                     <p>It's true, the pleaſure that the Saints take in God, is more or leſs, according to the different degrees of their love to God; and accordingly will the ſenſe of his abſence be more or leſs. There is <hi>a deſiring love,</hi> which is the higheſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of ſome weaker Chriſtians, and there is <hi>a delighting love,</hi> which is the attainment of the more grown Chriſtians. The purer and ſtronger the love, the greater pleaſures comes in, from the object of it, and the more impatience follows from its diſtance, and eſtrangement from it. The love of weaker Chriſtians puts forth, in thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings after the Lord, but they taſte but little of the ſweetneſs; but the more grown <hi>can ſit down under his ſhadow with great delight;</hi> yet neither the one nor the other, can be at eaſe or contented without him.</p>
                     <p>Again, there is a difference in the Natural tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and conſtitutions of Chriſtians; ſome are naturally of lively and warm affections, and of a chearful and ſerene Spirit; others are of more flat, and dull, and heavy ſpirits, and this will make a difference upon their ſence of things Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual. Yea, and the ſame perſons, at ſeveral times may be differing from themſelves, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of bodily diſtempers or occaſional diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſures, which may have ſuch an influence upon their Spirits, that they may at ſuch ſeaſons, not only have loſt the ſweetneſs of Divine commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but the ſence alſo of its want; and thoſe very duties, wherein they were wont to have delightful converſe with God, may ſeem the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:103224:123"/>
moſt uneaſie and weariſome work of their time.</p>
                     <p>But yet, whoever he be, that in ordinary, can be ſatisfied, at eaſe, and be merry, whilſt he is a ſtranger from God, and neither finds pleaſure in him, nor takes comfort in pleaſing of him; this man can never conclude that God is his portion. He that is leaſt in the Kingdom of God, will doubtleſs be able to ſay, Lord whom have I in Heaven, yea, [or in Earth] beſides thee.</p>
                     <p>Sinner, thou ſayeſt, that thou alſo haſt choſen the Lord; but how is it that he is no more look'd after, or regarded by thee? How is it that thou canſt live ſo much without God in the world, and find no miſs of his preſence? Art thou content to be miſerable whil'ſt thou liveſt here? or haſt thou choſen <hi>two portions,</hi> this world to be thy portion here, and God only for hereafter? I, that's the truth of the caſe; thou foreſeeſt that this world will not laſt alwayes, but thou muſt after a while, be gone and leave all behind thee; whil'ſt theſe things will laſt, thou wilt take up with them, but when they fail thee, thou coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt upon God at laſt; and ſo he muſt only ſtand by as thy laſt refuge; when all elſe is gone, then God muſt be thy happineſs. Is this thy choice of God, when thou canſt only ſay, <hi>Rather God than nothing?</hi> So I may be ſure of thee hereafter, I care not for thee now?</p>
                     <p>He that hath not choſen God for his happineſs in both worlds, hath ſincerely choſen him for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Canſt thou ſay, thou haſt choſen him for thy happineſs in this world alſo, when thou canſt count thy ſelf happy without him? canſt thou want communion with him, and yet be at hearts
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:103224:123"/>
eaſe? canſt thou take the proſperities of this world, to ſupply the want of a God? the ſmiles of fortune, inſtead of ſmiles from Heaven? will thy twilight or candle-light ſerve thee inſtead of Sun-light? Canſt thou quiet and comfort thy ſelf thus, God is none of my acquaintance, but I have good acquaintance enough in the world? God is angry with me, but I have many good friends about me that bear me good will? My work for Heaven goes but ſadly on, but yet I proſper and thrive in the Earth? I have none of the beſt hearts, I confeſs, but yet I have a good Houſe, and a good Eſtate? 'twould be ſad indeed if I had nothing either above or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, either within or without me, if both Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth had caſt me out; but whil'ſt one of them holds, 'tis well, mine own Ciſterne is full, and ſo long I can ſpare the Fountain. Canſt thou comfort thy ſelf thus? Deceive not thy ſelf, God is not the portion, thine heart hath choſen; thou wilt never find reſt in any thing elſe, who haſt pitch'd on him as thine only happineſs, and till thou haſt made him alone, thou haſt not made him at all, the portion of thy Soul.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>If you are willing and reſolved to forſake all things for his ſake.</hi> God and this world, are propoſed to our choice, and this is included, in the very nature of chooſing, that one be taken and the other left; 'tis not chooſing, to take both, one of the two muſt be parted with, or neither can be ſaid to be choſen; and ſo the word tells us, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.33. <hi>Whoever he be of you, that forſaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my Diſciple.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="268" facs="tcp:103224:124"/>This ſeems to be an hard word; but is it ſo indeed? Is it hard to part with all our Braſs, and to receive it in Gold? to exchange our rags for better clothing, our husks for better ſeeding? What is Earth to Heaven? Is all thou haſt in the world, too great a price to redeem thy Soul from Death, and to inſtate it in everlaſting bleſſedneſs? If theſe things could redeem thee, would'ſt thou ſay, 'tis too much to give, this Earth is more than Heaven is worth?</p>
                     <p>But farther conſider, It is not ſo hard as it ſeems to be; for, what is it to forſake all that we have? God would not have us to throw away our Eſtates, and make our ſelves voluntary Beggars; to give away our Houſes, and take up our Habitation in Dens or Caves; to give away all our bread, and our clothes, and leave our ſelves to hunger and nakedneſs.</p>
                     <p>God would not have us to break the peace with the world, to diſoblige and fall out with all our friends, and to become ſtrangers to our own fleſh; God would not have us ſtudiouſly to offend Father and Mother, to deſpiſe Brethren and Siſters; to be undutiful or unnatural, to be ſurly, and rude, and uncivil to any, and thereby create our ſelves enemies, and trouble; 'tis for the honour of Chriſtianity that we behave our ſelves ſweetly, and courteouſly, and dutifully towards all; and 'tis the Intereſt of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that thoſe that fear God, be good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and provident, and have Eſtates to ſerve him withall in their generations. This is not the meaning of our forſaking of all, to caſt our ſelves into voluntary poverty, or ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:103224:124"/>
to make our ſelves the objects, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the world.</p>
                     <p>That forſaking of all, which is neceſſary to, and will prove our ſincere chooſing the Lord, muſt be,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>In eſteem and affection;</hi> ſo as no longer to account or love any thing we have, <hi>as our portion and happineſs.</hi> God will not allow us two por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, one for the Fleſh, another for the Spirit; one for this world, another for the world to come; God will be all in both worlds. As we may not ſerve two Maſters, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.13. So neither may we have two portions; we cannot ſerve, and we may not love God and Mammon. God will be all or nothing to us, he will as ſoon allow us two Gods, as two portions; when we make the world our happineſs, we make it our God; and then we make it our happineſs, when we prize it too highly, love it too dearly, ſeek it too hotly; when we prize, or ſeek, or love the world more than God, or otherwiſe than in ſubordination to him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>In vote and reſolution,</hi> to let all go at the good pleaſure of God. To forſake all, is to get the heart looſe from all, to ſtand with a mind pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and ready to part with all whenever God will. To be able heartily to ſay, If God will have it ſo, I am willing to be poor, and every way as low as he pleaſes. Now I live in credit, but if God will have it ſo, I am willing of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and diſgrace; now I have friends, but if God ſhall ſee it good to leave me no friend in the world, I am content; now I live, and am in health, and proſper, and flouriſh, but whenever
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:103224:125"/>
the Lord will, I am content to wither, and ſuffer, and die for his Name.</p>
                     <p>A willingneſs to be poor, whenever God will have it ſo, this is a forſaking our riches; a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to be in diſgrace, to loſe our friends, or our lives at the pleaſure of the Lord, this is our forſaking all theſe. He that will loſe his life or eſtate when God calls him to it, in his account, he doth loſe it; there be more Martyrs in the world, than have ſuffered at a ſtake; if thine own heart hath given thee to the flames, as a witneſs or Sacrifice to God, 'tis accepted with him, as if thou hadſt been actually offered up.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Abraham</hi>'s intention and attempt to offer up <hi>Iſaac</hi> for a burnt-offering, was the ſame thing with God, as if he had done it, and had this teſtimony from the Lord, that he did it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.17. <hi>By Faith</hi> Abraham <hi>when he was tryed, offered up</hi> Iſaac, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.16, 17. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt done this thing, and haſt not withheld thy Son, therefore bleſſing I will bleſs thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Friend, art thou willing to be undone, willing to lay down thy life, when e're God ſhall put thee to it? God will ſay the like to thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt done this thing, therefore bleſſing I will bleſs thee, as 'tis on the other ſide, he whoſe heart withholds himſelf, or any thing that he hath; that will rather deny Chriſt, than ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for him; he whoſe heart is againſt it, and will not offer himſelf up, though he ſhould never be tryed, or put to it, the Lord will ſay to that man, becauſe thou haſt done this thing, haſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me, rather than thou wouldſt ſuffer for me, therefore curſing I will curſe thee. O how
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:103224:125"/>
many Apoſtates in heart are there, who did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver actually Apoſtatize, but would have done it, had they been put upon the tryal? Heart-Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs ſhall be accepted, and Heart-Apoſtates ſhall be rejected, even as they that are actually ſuch.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>In practice or execution,</hi> ſo as actually to let all go, whenever God doth call for it. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>To ſuffer the loſs of all, whenever it comes to be a caſe, that we muſt either ſuffer or ſin.</hi> Whoſo hath ſincerely choſen God, will chooſe affliction rather than iniquity. <hi>Elihu,</hi> Job. 36.21. would prove <hi>Job</hi> to be an Hypocrite, by this, that he had choſen <hi>iniquity rather than affliction;</hi> and if he could have made good the antecedent, that <hi>Job</hi> had made ſuch a choice, the conſequent would have been ſtrong againſt him.</p>
                     <p>It's true, every act of Sin, nay of ſinning deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately, and that when the temptation to it is is not great, doth not certainly evidence us to be Hypocrites; the Lord be merciful to us all, if it were ſo: the beſt of men turn aſide too often, from God to Sin, even when we are not much tempted to it, by ſuffering. But however, this is the principle, that every one that is ſincere, propoſes to himſelf to live by, to ſuffer rather than to Sin, to loſe all that he hath, rather than loſe his integrity; and his ordinary care and endeavour is, that his practice be according to this principle.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>To uſe all as God would have him.</hi> He that will not give an Alms, will much leſs give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for a Sacrifice; he that cannot ſpare his bread to the Lord, how will he ſpare his life? He that
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:103224:126"/>
beſtows and employs all that ever he hath, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as God by his ordinary providence, calls and appoints him, that layes up, and layes out, only according to Gods order, hath herein done that thing which will give him great ground of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that he hath an heart, that will let go all whenever he is call'd to it.</p>

                     <p>Now for the trial of our ſincere embracing of Chriſt, I ſhall put it upon this one thing, <hi>our hearty conſent to Chriſt.</hi> Chriſtians are joyned to Chriſt in <hi>a marriage union,</hi> Hoſ. 2.19. and 'tis conſent that makes the Marriage.

A knowledge of the <hi>conditions</hi> that he impoſes, and <hi>the Laws</hi> he gives to them that will be his Diſciples, and that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſalvation by him; as, to believe and obey the Goſpel, to repent and be converted.

Thou haſt given thy ſelf to Chriſt, but haſt thou given thy ſelf to Chriſtianity? thou calleſt thy ſelf his Servant, but doſt thou obey him as his Servant? art thou given to <hi>the works</hi> of Chriſt, given to Praying, given to Hearing, given to Holineſs? he hath thy name, but who hath the uſe of thee? to him thou haſt devoted thy ſelf, but by whom art thou employed? thou haſt parts, thou haſt ſtrength, thou haſt an eſtate, thou haſt time, but upon whom, or upon what, are all theſe actually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed? wilt thou ſay, thou haſt given thy ſelf to Chriſt, when the Devil hath ſtill the poſſeſſion,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:103224:130"/>
or the world and thy fleſh have ſtill the uſe of thee, and of all that thou haſt? Doſt thou ſerve this world, and walk after the fleſh, and yet wilt comfort thy ſelf with this, that thou haſt given thy ſelf to Chriſt?</p>
                     <p>Brethren, there may be a damnable miſtake here, and you that are profeſſors, look to it, that none of you be thus miſtaken, to your everlaſting ruine. It may be, thou haſt ſometimes gone into thy cloſet, and there falling upon thy knees, haſt ſaid, poſſibly with ſome affection, Lord I am thine, I here give my ſelf to thee, Body and Soul, and all that I have, to be thine for ever; and when thou haſt thus done, away thou goeſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing and comforted. But ſhortly after, the ſence of this tranſaction is worne off, and the power of it utterly loſt, and about the world thou goeſt as aforetime, walking at the ſame vain, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and careleſs rate, as thou wert us'd to do. What doſt thou think of ſuch a dedication? Haſt thou ſincerely dedicated thy ſelf to Chriſt, when thou ſuffereſt ſin and the world ſtill to have the poſſeſſion, and the uſe of thee? Art thou ſincerely given to Chriſt, when thou art not given to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity? art thou given to Chriſtianity, who art ſtill ſo given to thy fleſh, given to thy will, given to thine appetite, given to pleaſure, and eaſe, and idleneſs? Truſt not to any cloſet-Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, how ſolemn or affectionate ſoever they be, that have not ſo much power as to bring thee in, and deliver thee up, and actually engage thee in the Service of him, to whom thou haſt thus paſſed thy ſelf over. But of this
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:103224:130"/>
indeed, it is moſt proper to ſpeak, in the next mark.</p>
                     <p>The third Mark.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>A giving up our ſelves to the practice of a Godly life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That a Godly life is neceſſary, to prove the ſincerity of our choice of God, and our cloſe with Chriſt, is ſufficiently evident from what hath been ſaid in the two former marks; now it remains, that I add ſomething for farther trial, whether the life which we live be indeed a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life.</p>
                     <p>I have ſpoken to this, in the third mark of the truth of Grace which I have given in my <hi>Vindiciae pietatis,</hi> to which I muſt refer you, and ſhall now only add,</p>
                     <p>That he that lives a ſincere Godly life, hath ſuch a ſtanding care, to pleaſe God in all things, that he reſolves and endeavours,
<list>
                           <item>1. <hi>Not to allow himſelf in any known ſin.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>2. <hi>Not to allow himſelf in the neglect of any known duty.</hi>
                           </item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>He that lives a ſincere Godly life, makes it his care and endeavour never to allow himſelf in any known ſin.</hi> Rom. 7.15. <hi>the evil that I do, I allow not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now there may be a double allowance of ſin,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Poſitive,</hi> when we have ſuch a luſt after any iniquity, that our hearts, not being able to bear a reſtraint, do give themſelves a toleration for it.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="282" facs="tcp:103224:131"/>2. <hi>Interpretative,</hi> when we commit or live in any known ſin, and <hi>connive</hi> at our ſelves in it; and though we do not peremptorily reſolve, for continuing this liberty for it, yet neither do we reſolve againſt it. Non-reſolution againſt ſin is the door left open to it; when we do not hate nor reſiſt it, when we pray not, watch not, ſtrive not againſt it. It may be we wiſh in the general, that we could overcome, and avoid every iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and are content that God ſhould effectually reſtrain us by his grace, ſo it be, without putting us to the trouble and labour of laying any pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reſtraint upon our ſelves; yet when any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſins come, and we are tempted to them, they find the door left open to them, we wink at them, and ſwallow them down; even this muſt be interpreted an allowance of them. He that ſees the Thief at the door, though he do not ſay, pray come in, yet if he ſhut not the door againſt him, is acceſſary to his own Robberie. It is a vain thing for thee to ſay, the evil which I do I allow not, when thou do'ſt nothing to withſtand it. If thou wilt not reſiſt, thou do'ſt thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite the tempter and his temptations.</p>
                     <p>Grace, in the nature of it, is an enemy againſt Sin. <hi>Theſe two are contrary,</hi> Gal. 5.17. and though it be too weak wholly to overcome, yet will it make oppoſition againſt it. It's true, that actual allowance, eſpecially of ſome leſſer ſin, is not utterly inconſiſtent with the truth of grace, in this our imperfect ſtate; but he that reſolves not to watch againſt, to ſtrive againſt every ſin, that hath any ſtanding reſerve of a liberty for any one (in this thing the Lord par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:103224:131"/>
me) how dwelleth the grace of God in him?</p>
                     <p>Mens allowing themſelves thus in any ſin, is an argument that they are in a league with ſin; and he that is in a league with any ſin, his heart is not right with God. Our engaging our ſelves to the Lord, doth neceſſarily include in it our breaking with ſin; and our walking in friendſhip with God, is our living in the defiance of Sin. Haſt thou friendſhip with Sin? where is then thy friendſhip with God? Do'ſt thou ſay thou haſt not friendſhip with Sin, nor art in any league with it? how is it then, that it hath ſuch free acceſs to thee? Conſider it well, didſt thou maintain in thine heart, an enmity againſt ſin, thou would'ſt take more heed, how thou gaveſt it entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Wilt thou open thy boſom to a viper? would'ſt thou ſpread forth thine arms to a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent? ſure thou art of kin to theſe venomous beaſts, or thou would'ſt never allow them ſuch freedom with thee. It is at leaſt a ſhrewd ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that thou art of the ſeed of the Serpent, or thou would'ſt never take into thy boſome theſe young Serpents, thy luſts to be thy play-mates. And if thus thou do'ſt, and thine heart will not hear of being totally ſhut of its liberty with them, the caſe is then plain, thou art in ſuch a league with ſin, as will conclude thee out of Covenant with God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>He that lives a Godly life, doth heartily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve and endeavour, never to allow himſelf in the neglect of any known duty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By duties I mean, not only thoſe ſpecial acts of worſhip, Prayer, Hearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but all acts
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:103224:132"/>
of obedience to the will of God; both thoſe more general and complexe Duties, of working out our ſalvation, of walking as becometh the Goſpel, of making ſure our Calling and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and every particular duty compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under theſe; thoſe which have a more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate reſpect to God, our living in the faith, fear, and love of the Lord; thoſe alſo which have an immediate reſpect to our ſelves: our living ſoberly, temperately, in patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and thoſe which reſpect others: doing good to all men, admoniſhing, reproving, comforting, ſhewing mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as there is occaſion, and we have opportunity. As we are Chriſtians, we are indebted to others, to our Families, to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, to our Friends, and to our Enemies. I inſtance in all theſe, in ſpecial, in ſecond-table Duties, both becauſe there can be no proof made of the uprightneſs of our converſations, without looking into particulars, and becauſe there are many profeſſors who pretend to great heights in the matters of the firſt table, who in ſecond-table duties, are ſadly remiſs and negligent. Even theſe latter, are ſo eſſential to true Godlineſs, that whatever proofs we ſeem to have of our ſincerity, our neglects of theſe, eſpecially our allowed neglects will call all into queſtion.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe that will live Godly in Chriſt Jeſus, muſt live in all good Conſcience towards God, and towards men alſo. God will have his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſtand compleat in his whole will; that they may herein both approve themſelves in his ſight, and alſo ſhew forth his vertues before men, ſo that the world may ſee that the ſpirit of
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:103224:132"/>
Chriſtianity is not a fanatick and feeble thing, but hath a power in it to make a viſible and univerſal change, in the manners and wayes of thoſe that are poſſeſſed with it, that Chriſtians may appear to be the mercy, and the bleſſings, and the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the world. That Countries may ſee, that Families may ſee that it is a mercy that there are ſome Godly ones among them; that the unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Wife may ſee, that it is a mercy to have a believing Husband; that Grace hath made him better natur'd, more loving, more gentle, more tender of her good; that the unbelieving Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band may ſee, what a bleſſing it is to him to have a believing wife, that grace hath made her both a better woman, and a better Wife; more meek, more patient, more careful to pleaſe her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; that the unbelieving Families or perſons may find that it is a comfort and advantage to them to have ſo good a Maſter, to live by ſo good a neighbour, that pities them, that prays for them, and even Preaches to them, by his holy life and good example.</p>
                     <p>To be profeſſors of Chriſtianity, and yet to be all one in our converſations towards others, as quarrelſome, as contentious, as unmerciful, as unſavoury and unuſeful as thoſe that pretend to no Religion; to have thoſe about us to ſay, if there be grace in them, 'tis all one as to us, as if there were none; it had been all one for me, if my Father, or my Maſter, or my Husband, or my Wife, or my Neighbour had never medled with any thing of Religion; he is the ſame man, ſhe is the ſame woman, as proud, as pettiſh, as unkind, as unmerciful, as negligent of my good,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:103224:133"/>
that it could not have been worſe with me, if there had been no ſuch thing as Religion in them. What do'ſt thou think of all the Godlineſs thou haſt, if thou give occaſion to have it thus ſaid of thee?</p>
                     <p>Well all theſe particulars, and every other thing required in the Word of God, I underſtand by duties.</p>
                     <p>Now this is a man of a Godly life; he who having choſen God, and embraced Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, doth ſet his heart in all things to walk uprightly according to the truth of the Goſpel, without allowing himſelf in the neglect of any thing, that he knows <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc</hi> to be his duty; whoſe prayer it is, <hi>Hide not thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements from me,</hi> whoſe ſtudy it is, to know the whole will of God, and whoſe endeavour it is to walk in all the Commandements of God blameleſs; this is a man of a Godly life. This is according to the plain intent and meaning of his covenant with God, and this is his faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the covenant. <hi>Then ſhall I not be aſhamed, when I have reſpect unto all thy Commandements. [Then ſhall I not be aſhamed]</hi> that is, then ſhall I be upright in the way, and have boldneſs both before God and Men, <hi>[when I ſhall have reſpect]</hi> that is when it is in mine heart, to do thy whole will, without giving my ſelf leave, to turn aſide, either to the right hand or the left.</p>
                     <p>He that Lives in the neglect of the acts of worſhip, that prayes not, and hears not, he that neglects the general duties, that ſets not himſelf to ſeek the Kingdom of God, to work out his own Salvation, to walk as becometh the
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:103224:133"/>
Goſpel, but takes up with a careleſs, carnal, worldly, ſloathful life; whether he finds he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows himſelf in theſe great neglects, or thinks he does not, though his heart ſmites him, and will not ſuffer him to be quiet, or go out with ſuch a life in peace, the very neglect, or not engaging in theſe great and moſt neceſſary duties, does prove him an ungodly man; and 'twill not help this man to ſay, I allow not my ſelf in theſe neglects, for where-ever there is grace, there will be praying, and hearing, and ſomething done towards the working out our Salvation. 'T will never be found any man's godlineſs, that he allows not himſelf to live thus ungodlily, when yet he does it. Though he gives not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a deliberate toleration, if yet his heart take leave, to live thus without God in the world, his wayes will betray him, whoſe and what he is.</p>
                     <p>Yea and thoſe, that do ſomething in thoſe great and general duties; yet if they allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the neglect of any particular duties, that they know to be ſuch, in the neglect of Righteouſneſs, in the neglect of Mercy, in the neglect of their Families, and the duties they owe to them, in the neglect of Neighbour or Strangers, and the duties they owe to them, and can wink at, and diſpenſe with themſelves herein, ſuch men can never prove but their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is vain.</p>
                     <p>Art thou a Godly man, who art an unrighteous and unmerciful man? Art thou a good Chriſtian, who art no good Husband? Art thou a good Woman, who art an evil Wife? Art thou a good Man, who art a bad Neighbour, and giveſt
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:103224:134"/>
thy ſelf leave to be ſo? Art thou a Godly man, whom halting after the Lord, muſt ſerve thee inſtead of walking with God? Art thou a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower of Chriſt, who wilt have him abate thee ſome of his demands, abate thee truth, abate thee mercy, abate thee ſelf-denyal, or if he will not abate it to thee, any thing that thou likeſt not, thou wilt abate it to him? Is this to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, or entire in the way of the Lord? will God call that uprightneſs, which cannot be called integrity? and that ſure cannot be counted inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, which adviſedly leaves out any one of the Commandements of God.</p>
                     <p>But now he that gives himſelf to Prayer, Hearing, and praiſing the Lord, who makes it the ſcope and buſineſs of his life, to pleaſe God, and make ſure for eternity, ſtudying and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to approve himſelf in every thing, to him who ſearcheth the heart and tryeth the reins, and to keep himſelf unſpotted of the world, this is a Godly man, this is Religion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
                     <p>Though through infirmity, in many things he fall ſhort; he prayes, but is ſick of his praying, he hears, but is aſham'd to think how he hears; his Spirit is ſo often clouded and clog'd with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and infirmities, that he can feel no life, nor take any comfort in any thing he does; though by the power of corruption and temptation, he be at times put beſides praying, and other duties, and be ſometimes found in the field, when he ſhould have been in his Cloſet, in the Market, when he ſhould have been at Church; though he find his heart too often, running off from his work,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:103224:134"/>
and ſlinking away after his earthly buſineſſes, and gaines; and the vigorous proſecution of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign for heaven, be ſometimes intermitted; though he ſometimes fail in the ruling of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: in the governing of his thoughts and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and hereupon be ſurpriſed, by fits of pride, or of anger or impatience, (the more it is thus, the more doubtful will he unavoidably be, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſtate: and therefore dread to let thy luſts get head, or take incouragement from their word) yet if the bent of his heart and his courſe be towards the Lord, and his intention and indeavour, be to fulfil after him, not indulging but judging himſelf, for all his failings, and ſtriving within himſelf, to ſtand compleat in all the will of God, this man is a godly man: and becauſe he will not pardon himſelf, God will certainly pardon, and overlook all his infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and failings, and graciouſly accept him in Chriſt Jeſus, to whom be glory for ever, amen.</p>
                     <p>Now brethren, to gather up all that hath been ſaid, (for I would not have you to try by one, but by all three marks laid down) and ſo to bring this trial to an iſſue. That ſoul that hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately, and abſolutely choſen the Lord for his portion, reſolving to ſtand to his choice, and not to change for ever, that makes it the buſineſs of his life, to purſue his choice, and counts it the onely happineſs of his life to ſerve and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy that God whom he hath choſen; and for his ſake is willing to ſuffer the loſſe of all things; that ſo heartily approves of Chriſt, and his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that he accepts, and adventures his ſoul, and his hopes, upon him alone; that hath ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:103224:135"/>
himſelf, and given up, both the right and the poſſeſſion of himſelf to him, that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts himſelf no longer his own, but is a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant and follower of Chriſt in righteouſneſs and holineſs of life, heartily reſolving and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring, never to allow himſelf in any known ſin, nor in the neglect of any known duty; though his weakneſſes be great, his falls and failings be many, this man is beyond all queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a ſincere godly man.</p>
                     <p>Doeſt thou yet fear, whether thou be the man? let that fear, ſet thee a ſearching once and once again; let it follow thee into thine heart, and through all thy wayes; let it lay thee in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, and compare thee with this pourtraicture of a godly man, which is now ſet before thee; if this will not ſerve to quiet and ſatisfie thee, I know no more to ſay to thee, but that thou di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently ſet thy ſelf, by increaſing in the grace of God, and outgrowing thy ſinful weakneſſes and failings, to outgrow thy fears and thy doubts.</p>
                     <p>And when at length thou art come to a clear judgment, that this is thy caſe, then, <hi>Son be of good comfort thy ſins are forgiven thee;</hi> if God have ever a child, if there be ever an heir of the Kingdom of heaven in the world, thou art one. If thou be not miſtaken in thy ſelf, but this be a true character of thee, I am miſtaken in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, if, thou be not a Godly and a bleſſed man. Thou haſt ſincerely choſen the Lord, and that's a ſure ſign that he hath choſen thee, <hi>John</hi> 15.16. Thou art ſincerely come unto Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will in no wiſe caſt thee out, <hi>John</hi> 6.37. Thou ordereſt thy converſation aright, and
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:103224:135"/>
therefore, to thee will he ſhew the Salvation of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.23. Thou ſhalt ſee the good of his choſen, and rejoyce with the joy of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and glory with his inheritance.</p>
                     <p>And now methinks, there ſhould be a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured face, upon this mixed company, ſome of you methinks, ſhould have the joy of the Lord in your countenances, and his praiſes in your lips. What, hath the Almighty brought me hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto? hath he indeed taken me for his own, and mark'd me up for life? hath he given me an heart to pitch upon him, and to accept of his ſon, and thereby witneſſed that I am accepted of him? Is this his very Image which is to be ſeen upon mine heart and life, and may I now ſay with boldneſs, <hi>I am my beloveds and my beloved is mine? bleſſe the Lord O my ſoul, and all that is within me, bleſſe his holy name.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Others methinks, ſhould be ſighing and ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for fear. Theſe are the bleſſed of the Lord, but O in what caſe am I? wo is me, if none be the Lords but thoſe that have thus choſen him for theirs; if none be the redeemed ones of Chriſt, but thoſe that are his followers in holineſs, and righteouſneſs, O I dread to think, whoſe I am! Have I choſen the Lord? am I a follower of Chriſt? woe woe is me, 'tis too evident that I have choſen earth and vanity and am a follower after lies. Ah wretch that I am, are all my hopes, is all my confidence now at laſt come to this?</p>
                     <p>Sinner, how is it that thy ſoul is not yet in ſackcloth and aſhes, that trembling and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath not taken hold of thee? Art thou yet
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:103224:136"/>
in quiet, art thou yet at eaſe? Is it nothing to thee, to ſee thy ſelf without Chriſt, and without God in the world? or canſt thou wink ſo faſt, that thou canſt not yet ſee that this is thy very caſe? ſure thou haſt loſt either thine eyes, or thine heart, if thy fears are not yet fallen upon thee.</p>
                     <p>As for you O beloved, whom theſe markes have proved to be the Lord's, Rejoyce in the Lord ye righteous, and again I ſay rejoyce; and ſtudy to confirm and eſtabliſh your hearts in the joy of the Lord, by walking worthy of that grace wherein you ſtand.</p>
                     <p>And thus I have diſpatched the firſt branch, of the firſt direction. Search what good there is in you, or whether there be the grace of God in truth in your hearts.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Search what evils there are found in you.</hi> You that have made a through proof of the grace of God in you, by what hath been already ſaid, this part of the direction which yet remaines, is intended, as to you, to humble you under, and make you more watchful againſt thoſe evils which yet remain.</p>
                     <p>But its chiefly intended to that ſort of profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, who having but ſlightly ſearch'd themſelvs, have gotten up to a confidence, that they are the children of God.</p>
                     <p>In order to your making a further diſcovery of your ſelves, beſides what hath been already hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſame purpoſe, let me adviſe you to ſearch yet deeper, what ſins and corruptions there may be found in you, you hope there is the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:103224:136"/>
good ſeed ſown, but what tares are there to be found in you? Some tares will be found in the beſt fields, ſome weeds will remain in the beſt gardens; but ſearch if there be no <hi>ranke-weeds,</hi> ſuch as uſe not to be found in the garden of the Lord, whether there be no groſſe, nor reigning ſins with any of you; or if any ſuch be, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be ſuffered to grow and get head, and overtop, and choke thoſe hopeful blades, when ever they appear, is your hand upon them to pluck them up, or your foot upon them to tread them down: Deal faithfully, and paſſe through all your fields, mark and obſerve your ways, and ſee what you can find.</p>
                     <p>Or if your life be clearer than it hath been, and you find not much above ground, ſearch what's under ground, dig down to the roots; deſcend into your hearts, and when you go down into theſe deeps, go down trembling, to think what you may find there, though you have waſht your face, and wip'd your mouth, and cleanſed your hands, yet fear what you may find below. Men that go down into the bottom of a deep Well, or into ſome dark vault, or cavern of the earth, they go down trembling, there may be toads or ſnakes, <hi>Jym</hi> and <hi>Ohim</hi> may dwell there; and you alſo know not, what you may find in your deeps. Tremble as you go down in ſearch after the evils of your hearts. If there be no oaths nor lyes, no murthers, or adulteries, in your lives, yet there may be whole neſts of them, in your hearts. See if there be no Images of Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie ſet up there, before which all within you fall down and worſhip; if there be not another
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:103224:137"/>
God within, beſides him that hath gotten the name without. Search narrowly, from room to room, from corner to corner, it may be you may find ſuch evils, as may amaze and aſtoniſh you.</p>
                     <p>If the Lord ſhould lead you through your hearts, as once he led the prophet, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8.5. &amp;c. from place to place, and firſt ſhewed him the Image of jealouſie, and then by an hole through a wall, and a door, led him further, where he ſaw every form of creeping things, and abominable beaſts, &amp; all the Idols of the houſe of Iſrael pourtrayed upon the wall, and the ancients of Iſrael worſhiping them; and leading him yet further, he ſaw more and more, and greater a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations than theſe. If you ſhould thus go in ſearch through your hearts, God knows, what abominations you might find, which yet you have not diſcovered nor ſuſpected. It may be, you may find the world ſitting upon the throne within you; and if there be not the form of every creeping thing, yet all the <hi>beasts</hi> of the field, your horſes and your oxen and your Sheep, may be pourtrayed and engraven upon your hearts, theſe temples of the Lord, may be made ſtables, and ſtalls, and folds, and barnes, where your cattel and your corn may be lodg'd and laid up; nay poſſibly you may find them dunghils, full of Toads and Adders; lyes and adulteries, and all manner of unclean luſts may be breeding in them. Or If you find nothing elſe, ſee if that Image of Jealouſie [Self] be not found behind the curtain, ſitting upon the throne of God, with a crown of pride upon its head, and
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:103224:137"/>
all within you, even your very religion, doing homage to it, and being made its ſervants.</p>
                     <p>Friends, you little think what an inſide you may have, whatever your outſide be. Dig through the wall, look through the hole, and enter by the door, and ſearch with trembling, leſt, where you hope to find Chriſt and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of grace, you ſhould find the unclean ſpirit with his abominations.</p>
                     <p>There have been many in the world, who have been taken for ſincere converts, yea, and eminent Chriſtians, in whom the divel hath ſeem'd to be ſlain at the firſt ſhot, the old man hath ſeem'd to be knock'd down, at the firſt blow; and all on a ſudden there hath appeared a ſpring tide of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joyes and heavenly affections, and their ſouls have been, as it were caught up into the third heaven, aſſoon as they have gotten their heads up out of the mud and mire; and yet after awhile, the old man gets heart again, and thoſe luſts which had been layd aſleep for the time, have riſen, up and gotten head again, and that filthy fountain, which was thought to have been quite drained, and damm'd up, hath broken its bay, and caſt out as great a floud of iniquities as ever there was before.</p>
                     <p>O fear, leſt it ſhould be thus with thee, leſt whatever there be at top, there be that lying at the bottom, which may undo thee for ever: leſt ſin and the divel be onely laid aſleep, but not ſlain; leſt, though the enemy be beaten out of the field, he be but only beaten into his hold, where he ſtill fortifies himſelf. And be ſure though he ſhould have loſt his outworks, yet whileſt he
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:103224:138"/>
makes good the ſtrong hold, though the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels be ſwept and cleanſed, yet if the ſink be choked up with mud and filth; though the iſſues of the Apoſtumes be ſtop'd and dried, yet if the bag and core be not gotten out; though thou haſt quite another face, and ſeemeſt quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man than heretofore, though every one that ſees thee rejoyces in the change that's made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, and with the greateſt confidence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims the, A convert, a diſciple, an Iſraelite indeed, and thou bleſſeſt thy ſelf in thine own heart, ſaying, Now I have peace yet is there that within, which will break down all thy hopes, and make thy friends aſhamed of their joyes they once had over thee. Fear leſt this ſhould be thy caſe, and get thee down into thine heart, and ſearch yet again, whether it be or no.</p>
                     <p>Brethren, I would not check the leaſt buds of the ſpring, I would not nip the firſt bloſſomings, towards true grace &amp; peace; I would cheriſh the leaſt of the new creatures of God, from the firſt ſpringing of the babe in the womb; O that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſoul among you, were come ſo far onward, as the little ones among you. God forbid, that any of you ſhould be diſcouraged or frighted back, by your being put in fear, that you are not yet come home. But however, he that is gotten up to a confidence, that the work is done, that he hath the ſeed of God, and the life of God within him, let him ſearch if there be not ſuch hidden wickedneſſes within him, which he never minded, nor thought on, that may give him juſt ground to fear, and in fear to put it again to the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:103224:138"/>
queſtion, whether his eſtate be ſo good, and ſo ſure as he concluded it.</p>

                  <p>There is an <hi>uncovering</hi> of ſin, which is ſomething towards its covering. <hi>He that confeſſeth and forſaketh his ſin ſhall have mercy, Prov.</hi> 28.13. confeſſion is the way to remiſſion. Sin is never hid till it be thus open'd</p>
                  <p>There is an <hi>impudent</hi> opening of ſin, and a <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent</hi> opening of it.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>There is a penitent opening of ſin,</hi> and that is, by confeſſing it, and condemning our ſelves for it; and this is the opening, that is the way to hide it. Confeſſion leads on to repentance, and repentance to remiſſion, the confeſſing peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent carries his ſin to Chriſt for a pardon, and that's its covering. <hi>In that time the iniquity of Iſrael ſhall be ſought for, and there ſhall be none; and the ſins of Judah, and they ſhall not be found.

Their remiſſion is ſuch a covering of ſins, as righteouſneſs will not look through, to revenge them.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, get your ſins thus hidden, ſee that they do not lye open to the revenger; confeſſe them, repent of them, get you to Chriſt for a pardon. Do not deny or extenuate them, 'tis ſad covering ſin with ſin, that will be as the diping the wool in the furnace the ſecond time, the dye will be the deeper. Get the Covenant, the blood of the Covenant for a covering. Carry your ſores and your ulcers open before the Lord, for his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering. LORD 'tis a vain thing for me to deny it, or to excuſe what I have done, it cannot be excuſed; <hi>I have done fooliſhly, I have done wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, and mine iniquity is marked before thee,</hi> I am an unclean thing, all wounds, and bruiſes, and putrifying ſores. A covering Lord a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to hide this unclean thing out of ſight, a garment Lord, a garment rolled in blood, to hide the ſhame of my nakedneſs.</p>
                  <p>Friends, are your ſins hid? yes, mine are I hope; but what covering haſt thou gotten? There are five ſorts of coverings (beſides thoſe already mentioned) under which mens ſins are often hid.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>A covering of ignorance;</hi> they know not ſin to be ſin, the blind ſee not their own ſpots, and thereupon think there are no ſpots upon
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:103224:140"/>
them; their darkneſs ſerves them for a covering Thou that ſayeſt thine heart is clean, it may be 'tis for want of eyes, thou ſeeſt not what an heart it is, when do we hear ever a word of complaint, or confeſſion from thee? <hi>There is no ſoundneſs in my fleſh,</hi> (ſaith the pſalmiſt) <hi>becauſe of thine anger, nor reſt in my bones by reaſon of my ſin, my wounds ſtink and are corrupt, my loynes are filled with a loathſome diſeaſe, and there is no ſoundneſs in my fleſh, Pſal.</hi> 38.3. &amp;c. Such are the complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the righteous, but when doſt thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain? thou art whole and ſound, thou ſayeſt; I but tis becauſe thou art blind, thou thinkeſt ſo; if God ſhould open thine eyes, thou wouldeſt ſee ſuch ſights, as would amaze thee.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Oblivion, or their own forgetfulneſs,</hi> whileſt mens ſins are freſh in their memory, they are ſometimes afraid, but after a while, they are forgotten, and all buried in Oblivion. Thou a good Chriſtian? thou an honeſt man, and haſt done no harm? remember thy ſelf, look to the dayes of old, call back the things that are paſt. Where wert thou at ſuch a time, and ſuch a time, what wert thou then a doing? call to mind thine oathes, and thy lying, and thy drunkenneſs and thy companions in ſin. Haſt thou done nothing amiſſe? rub up thy memory, and that will help thine eye ſight.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Hardneſs of heart,</hi> ſome ſinners can feel no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and they can ſee nothing but what they feel. Nothing is evil with them, but what is uneaſie, nothing is ſin, but what ſmarts. The
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:103224:140"/>
Apoſtle tell us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.18.19. That men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out underſtanding are <hi>paſt feeling,</hi> and ſure thoſe that are without feeling, are ſo much the more paſt underſtanding; the brawn upon their hearts, is a film upon their eyes. Seeſt thou nothing to trouble thee? O hard heart! what, ſuch a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, ſuch a ſcoffer, ſuch an earthworm, ſuch a prodigal, and yet ſeeſt thou nothing to trouble thee? if God ſhould but ſmite this rock, that would open thine eyes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Some hide their ſins, in other mens greater ſins,</hi> by looking on the greater blazes of other mens ſins, their own embers, that lye moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the aſhes are not ſeen. If they can ſay with the Phariſee, <hi>I am not as other men,</hi> they will not ſee, but they are honeſt men, and no hurt found in them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Others will hide their ſins in the Church,</hi> will take up ſome little profeſſion of religion, and make ſo much reformation, as will give them admiſſion into a congregation of Chriſtians, or it may be but into a ſect or party, that call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Chriſtians; to whom when they have once joined themſelves, ther's an end of their old ſins. If they have gotten a new skin upon them, and are hang'd on, as members of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt, (as they think) then they go for new men, and all their old things are vaniſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
                  <p>But ſinners, are theſe the only coverts, in which your ſins are hid? in your ignorance, in your forgetfulneſs, &amp;c. From whoſe eyes will theſe
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:103224:141"/>
coverings hide them? will they hide them from Gods eyes, or is it onely from your own eyes? Is this all you need, to hide your ſelves from your ſelves? woe be to thoſe men, whoſe ſins are open before the eyes of the Lord, and only hid from their own.</p>
                  <p>Will any of theſe coverings hide them from the Lord? Becauſe you ſee not, doth not God ſee? becauſe you have forgotten, hath God forgotten? O if there were ſuch a book of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, of all that you have done, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you, as is written againſt you before the the Lord, how pale would your faces grow? If God ſhould now come in amongſt us, and read over to each ſinner, the roll that is written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, what a trembling congregation would this be: how would you look one upon another, as men aſtoniſhed! how would you ſtrike upon your breaſts, and ſmite upon your thighs, and ſpeak trembling, men and brethren, what ſhall we do! what eaſe would it be to you, when you hear ſo much written in your own books, to think there is more written againſt ſome others? And what if you be gotten into the church, and your ſins be buried under the ſhadow of the Altar, under your profeſſion of religion? will not God ſee them there?</p>
                  <p>Conſider ſinners, are your ſins repented of and pardoned? hath the Lord caſt them behind his back, and blotted them out of his book? you have made a ſhift to blot them out of yours, but what if they ſhould be ſtill found on Gods book? nay is it not certainly ſo, do they not all ſtand there againſt you, even all the ſins you have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:103224:141"/>
in your lives? O look ye out for a better covering; haſt ye, haſt ye, cry for a pardon, ſue out an act of oblivion from heaven, look unto Jeſus, get your ſins nail'd to his croſſe, and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in his grave. <hi>Repent and be converted that your iniquities may be blotted out,</hi> and in that day, the iniquity of Iſrael ſhall be ſought for, and there ſhall be none, and the ſins of <hi>Judah,</hi> and they ſhall not be found.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Get your ſouls hid;</hi> hid with Chriſt in God. <hi>I flee unto thee to hide me, Pſal.</hi> 143.9. <hi>I will truſt in the covert of thy wings, Pſal.</hi> 61.4. Chriſt will be no hiding place for your ſins, unleſs your ſouls alſo take ſanctuary in him. Get thee in to Chriſt; if thou be found in him, thy ſin ſhall not be found. Hide thee from Chriſt, in Chriſt; in the bloud and bowels of Chriſt a Saviour, from the fury and wrath of Chriſt a judge. Great is the wrath of that day; there will be no enduring, and there can be no eſcaping that wrath, but by himſelf. Woe be to thoſe that ſhall then be found out of Chriſt, in what ever elſe they be found. <hi>The kings of the earth, and the grat men, the Rich men and the Captaines and the mighty men</hi> (that are found out of Chriſt). <hi>ſhall hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in dens, and the rocks of the mountaines, and ſhall ſay to the mountaines, fall on us, and to the rocks, cover us, and hide us from him that ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth on the throne, and from the wrath of the lamb, for the great day of his wrath is come, and who ſhall be able to ſtand,</hi> Rev. 6.15.16.17.</p>
                  <p>O ſinners, you that have ventured it, to ſtand out from Chriſt hitherto, look before you, to
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:103224:142"/>
that great day that comes; you that neglect the Mercy, think how you can poſſibly eſcape the Wrath of the lamb. Truſt not to the ſecreſie of dens, to the mercy of mountains, to the might of rocks; theſe will all be as deaf to your cry, as you are to the cry of the Lord. Now you have a rock before you, which will then be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refuge; put you into the clefts of this rock, and the indignation ſhall paſs over you, ſtay out at your utmoſt peril.</p>
                  <p>Wretched ſouls, how is it that tis ſo hard, to perſwade you in to Chriſt? How is it that the clifts of this rock, have ſo long opened to you, yea that the rock hath followed you, and cryed after you, put in hither and you ſhall be ſafe, and yet ſo few have been perſwaded in? Lord how few! how many ſtill ſtand without, and it may be, are mocking at the fears of them that are gotten in.</p>
                  <p>Sinner, how canſt thou think without a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling heart of being found out of Chriſt, in that great day of his wrath? O fear, fear and beware, fear and hide; hide thy ſelf in Chriſt, and then thy great fear will be over, <hi>There is no condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them that are in Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8.1.</p>

                  <p>Beware ſinners, that that precious blood be not thus found upon you. Impenitent ſinners, the guilt of Chriſts blood is upon them, they are his betrayers and murtherers, and by their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence in ſin, they allow the deeds of thoſe wicked ones that crucifyed him.</p>
                  <p>What's ſaid of Apoſtates, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.6. is charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able upon all impenitent ſinners, <hi>They crucifie the Son of God afreſh,</hi> for.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Sinners, your going on in your ſins, is a kind of doing that wicked act, of crucifying Chriſt, once and once again. Every oath that you ſwear, every lye that you tell, every ſcoffe that you caſt out, againſt Chriſt and his ways; is your cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying him afreſh. This is the voice of your ſins, <hi>crucifie him, crucifie him;</hi> on with his mocking robes and crown again, ſpit at him and buffet him again, ſcourge him again, up with him to the croſſe, and nail him, and pierce him again. Every ſinner is bringing in more thornes, and more nailes, and more vinegar and gall, and more ſpears to thruſt him thorough. Here, take my thornes, ſaith one, take my nailes, ſaith ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, take my ſpunge and my ſpear ſaith another, and ſtrike to the heart. And the cry of this your fact is, the guilt of his blood be upon us. Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble O impenitents, did you ever think that there
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:103224:143"/>
there had been ſo much in your impenitence as this?</p>
                  <p>But 2. <hi>There is the Attonement of Chriſts blood,</hi> and in this ſence tis, I exhort you to cry; his blood by upon me; let that blood of ſprinkling, which ſpeaks better things than the blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> as it is peace and a propitiation for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſo let it be upon me. Beg of Chriſt to take you in, and make you partakers of the merit of his blood, of the vertue of his blood, whereby your iniquities may be pardoned, and purged away; that when they are ſought for, they may not be found. Go ſinner, go unto Jeſus, lift up thine eyes, lift up thy voice, ſtand crying at his door, Lord open to me, Lord take me in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thy pardoned ones, let the blood of the lamb be ſprinkled upon me.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Conſent to Chriſt, whileſt he offers to take you in,</hi> you may know what's to be done, to get in to Chriſt, by conſidering over that <hi>ſpecial mark</hi> which I have already given you, to prove your being in Chriſt. Tis <hi>your conſent,</hi> that will prove you to be in Chriſt, and the ſame which will be your evidence, will give you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance in him.</p>
                  <p>Sinners, give your conſent to Chriſt; get your hearts <hi>to approve of him,</hi> to be will ſatisfied, that tis ſafe venturing upon him, that he is a ſure refuge, that both can and will hide you from the wrath to come. <hi>Accept of Chriſt;</hi> If you be ſatisfied that tis ſafe venturing with him, make your adventure, embarque with this faithful Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot,

What wilt thou have me to do Lord? how wilt thou have me to live? ſpeak Lord, i'le henceforth know no other voice but thine; this world ſhall be no longer heard, againſt the voice of Chriſt, this fleſh ſhall be no longer heard, againſt the voice of Chriſt, depart uſurpers, I am neither mine own nor yours, what have I any longer to do with you? I am Chriſts, and him only will I ſerve, and through the help of the Lord I will go from this place, bound in the ſpirit, and reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in mine heart; to be governed guided and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by him alone. This is the full and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led purpoſe of mine heart, and O that this my reſolution may be attended with ſuch an effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al power, that may make a preſent actual change upon my whole courſe and way of life. Well I will go in the ſtrength of the Lord, and let me find the preſence and the power of the Almighty with me. O that I might not go out of this houſe, nor be ſeen in the ſtreets, but the tongues of thoſe that ſee me, might ſay, where hath this man, or this woman been this day? what hath been done to them? whence is this ſtrange change?

                  <p>What ſay you friends, are you now for ſuch a change? come and give your ſelves thus to the Lord, and then fear not, to commit your ſelves to his cuſtody; truſt him for your pardon, truſt him for protection, leave the care of your ſouls upon him for ever. Faithful is he that hath called you, and will take care of you. Now you have a ſure title to him, and are hid in his blood, and this blood of the lamb, ſhall be to you as the ſcarlet line on the window of <hi>Rhahab,</hi> was to her, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 2.18. or as the blood of the Paſchal lamb ſprinkled on the lintels, and door-poſts of <hi>Iſrael, Exod.</hi> 12. your certain ſecurity, that the indignation ſhall paſſe over you, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer ſhall not hurt you for ever.</p>

Doſt thou not feel the chains on thy neck, &amp; the fetters on thy feet? art thou not made to ſerve under thine enemies, whom thou canſt not find in thine heart but to obey, tho it be to the cutting of thine own throat? Thou art not left at liberty, to act as a Chriſtian, <hi>according to the Goſpel,</hi> no nor as a man <hi>according to thine own reaſon and conſcience,</hi> but art made a mere brute of, to ſerve the pleaſure of the devil and thy luſts. Art thou content to live and die ſuch a ſlave? behold, the whole world is for liberty; what groanings are there under oppreſſion, what out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries againſt impoſitions, and invaſions, upon rights and priviledges, and what impatience of vaſſalage and ſervitude? and canſt thou be ſo pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, of the impoſitions of luſt, and thy vaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage under the devil? canſt thou dwell for ever, under the uſurpers? is there any tyranny like

                  <p>It is not barely a ceſſation from the acts of ſin, that I am now preſſing you to; (let him that ſtole, ſteal no more, let him that was a ſwearer, or a lyar, or a drunkard, ſwear no more, put away lying, and turn away from the wine and the ſtrong drink) but get you free from your ſtate of ſin, get you up out of priſon, ceaſe not only from doing the work, but continue not under the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the divel, be no longer the practiſer, no nor the priſoners of ſin.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt came not to make your priſon more clean or more eaſie, to caſt out ſome of your filth, or to get you an abatement of ſome of your drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery work, but <hi>to bring forth the priſoners out of priſon, Iſaiah.</hi> 42.7.

                  <p>Sinners are not only employed, and ſet on work by ſin and the devil, but they are ſold un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſin, held under ſin, ſhut up under unbelief. They are priſoners, not only by conſtraint but by conſent alſo, they are voluntary priſoners, they have made a league with ſin, and are its cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-ſervants; they are not onely priſoners to Satan but to their own hearts, the heart of man is become ſo very a devil, that it is its own gao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler; the devil cannot commit a ſinner into ſafer cuſtody, than by making his own heart his keeper.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="312" facs="tcp:103224:146"/>Sinners, thoſe hearts of yours are become ſuch Devils incarnate, ſo deſperately ſet againſt Chriſt, ſo deeply engaged in ſoul-damning works, that if God ſhould leave you to the cuſtody and conduct of your own natures, theſe will lead you on to your damnation. 'Tis now become natural to ſinners, to hate the Lord and his way of life; Sin hath made ſuch changelings of them from what they originally were, that 'tis their nature to play the fools, and the beaſts; 'tis their nature to be proud, to be froward, to be malicious, 'tis mens corrupt nature, that ſo ſtrongly enclines them, to follow the Devil and flee from Chriſt. The Chicken doth not more naturally follow the Hen, and flee from the Kyte; than Sinners do follow that Kyte, the Devil, and flee from Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>As 'tis ſaid of the Devil, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.44. <hi>When he ſpeaketh a lye, he ſpeaketh of his own,</hi> ſo may it be ſaid of ſinners, when they do wickedly, they do of their own; when they lye, and ſwear, and mock, and riot, they do of their own. <hi>Their inward part is very wickedneſs,</hi> Pſal. 5.9. Their hearts are a fountain of iniquity, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.7. <hi>As a fountain caſteth forth waters, ſo ſhe caſteth forth wickedneſs.</hi> She caſteth forth her wickedneſs, not only <hi>continually,</hi> as a fountain caſts out wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (the fountain runs night and day, Summer and Winter, from year to year) but with the ſame <hi>freedome</hi> alſo, there's no need of the Pump or the Bucket, to fetch it up, it flows forth of it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Such a ſtate as this, are ſinners in; they are Priſoners, and voluntary Priſoners, natural
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:103224:146"/>
ſlaves; whoſe ſervile ſpirits are altogether ſuited to their ſervile ſtate; who whileſt they continue thus, are fit for nothing elſe but to be made ſlaves of, they are fit for no other Maſter but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, for no other work but wickedneſs. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature is their chain to bind them to the Devil, and his cord to drag them to deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>Art thou not afraid, Sinner, to ſtay any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in ſuch a ſtate? ſure thou doſt not know where thou art, or thou could'ſt not but fear. When Chriſt intends to fetch ſinners out, he firſt makes them to ſee where they are. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.7. <hi>He opens the blind eyes, and brings forth the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners from the Priſon.</hi> He opens their eyes, not barely that they may ſee their way out, but that they may ſee, what a Priſon 'tis they are in, what a vile Priſon, what a ſtrong Priſon, what Irons there are upon them, and what a dark hole, and diſmal dungeon, there is in the bottom of it, into which they are dropping, and unto which they are reſerved in theſe chains and fetters. There's little hope of perſwading ſinners out, till upon the ſight of their miſery and danger, they are afraid to continue longer there.</p>
                  <p>O I am afraid, and yet I cannot get looſe; why what is it that hinders thee? O this evil heart holds me in, whatever danger I am in, this evil nature will venture it all, rather than go to Chriſt. All within me cries in mine ears, ſtay, ſtay where thou art, this bondage is liberty, in compariſon of that ſtate that Chriſt would bring me to. Ay, that's it indeed, this corrupt nature
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:103224:147"/>
is thy Priſon and thy Gaoler; and till the power of nature be broken, till the ſtream of nature be turned, till thoſe bars and gates be cut in pieces, the fleſhly will and its luſts, by which thou art holden in, there will be no getting forth. Thou haſt been called back often, and yet thou goeſt on as thou didſt; how comes this to paſs? why thy nature leads thee on, thy nature holds thee faſt, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.7, <hi>You [like men] have tranſgreſſed,</hi> you like men have been hardned; you have done like your ſelves. Like men! like brutes or ſtocks rather, why that's the ſame, man is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come brutiſh, and his fooliſh heart turn'd into a ſenſeleſs ſtock, and yet this heart muſt have the cuſtody and government of thee.</p>
                  <p>O flee every one of you, flee away from your ſelves, ariſe, eſcape for your lives; is this the ſtate out of which you are ſo loth to depart? Men and Brethren, ſave your ſelves from this woful ſtate. O generation, who hath forwarned you, that you ſhould flee, (ſhall I ſay?) nay, who hath bewitched you, that you will not flee from the wrath to come? Get you up, get you up out of this evil ſtate. How is it that you ſtir not? how is it that we yet hear no ſuch cry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, <hi>Maſter ſave us, we periſh. Thus ſaith the King, Come out;</hi> will you ſay, no, but I will dye here? Flee Sinners,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>As Lot out of Sodome,</hi> though you muſt leave all behind you; all your ſubſtance, all your kindred and acquaintance; the fire and the brimſtone is coming, get you gone and leave all behind you.</p>

                  <p>Riſe up every man and woman, ſhake off your fetters, ſlay your keeper (ſome Priſoners have broken Priſon by knocking their Gaoler on the head) get this old heart ſlain, and get you a new heart, when that's once done, then you have broken Priſon, and your ſouls are eſcaped.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Flee the practice of Sin.</hi> Say not I am now in Chriſt, and my ſin ſhall never ſeparate me from him.

evidence and uphold the power of ſin; what clearer evidence that ſin is Lord ſtill, than when its Laws are obeyed? who can think that the root is dead, whileſt the branches bear and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh? How is a tree known, but by its fruits?

Do men gather Gourds of Vines, or Hawes of the fig-tree?</p>
                  <p>2 Tim. 2.19. <hi>Let every one that nameth the name of Chriſt, depart from iniquity.</hi> Art Thou in Chriſt, who art not turn'd from thy ſins? Do not ſay, I hope I may be, (however) hereafter, and ſo indulge thy ſelf thy liberty in ſin, till Chriſt come and ſet thee free; but whether thou be in Chriſt, or yet ſhort of him, put away ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity from thee; let there be a preſent forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the acts of ſin, and that will be a means to deſtroy its habits; as it is with ſome plants, by cutting them off above ground, you may kill the roots. Do not ſay, I will be a Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, till God give me a new heart, I will go on in this ſwearing, and lying, and mocking, till God work a change upon this evil heart; this is thy reſiſting the work of God, and ſuch a wicked reſolution as may provoke the Lord to leave thee for ever, under the power of Sin and the Devil. Whatever thou be, go preſently and put away every iniquity from thee, greater or ſmaller, open or ſecret, corporal or ſpiritual wickedneſſes, have done with them all. Do not
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:103224:148"/>
only lament, or mourn for ſin, but fight againſt it, and the beſt fighting is by flying. The Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of this world when they flee once, the fight is loſt; but Chriſt's Souldiers never fight well but when they fly; when you fly ſin you have won the field; when the Devil flyes, he is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; when you fly, you have overcome.</p>
                  <p>Flee all ſin, but eſpecially your <hi>beloved and accuſtomed ſins,</hi> remember what I have ſaid of theſe already. Be not the men you have been us'd to be, do not the evils you have lov'd to do. I do not yet mean, that you ſhould only change your ſins, forbear covetouſneſs, and turn prodigals, give off your drudgery for this world, and give your ſelves to idleneſs, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear prophaneneſs, and turn hypocrites, but put away all iniquity, eſpecially your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed and beloved ſins.</p>
                  <p>Friends, whenever you ſee your old ſins, that have gotten your hearts, coming upon you, and aſſaulting you, as ſuppoſe pride, ſuppoſe covetouſneſs, or ſinful anger, or the like, which you have been us'd to be overcome by, whenever you find your ſelves tempted to any of theſe again, let your hearts ſtartle at it, <hi>Here comes my deadly enemy.</hi> I know you of old, what a ſnare you have been to me, what a meer ſlave you have made of me. I remember how it hath been with me, all the time that I have been go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by this covetouſneſs, led by theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, commanded by theſe paſſions, or this fleſhly appetite; theſe are they, that kept me back from Chriſt, that thruſt out every good thought, quench'd every good motion, reſiſted
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:103224:149"/>
every good word, that was ſpoken to me. When the Word of God, the Miniſters of Chriſt, and mine own Conſcience call'd upon me, Go foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Soul, joyn thy ſelf to Chriſt, make thy peace with God, accept of Grace, ſubmit to Mercy, turn at his reproofs, ſuch was their power over me and I was ſo bewitched to them, that I could not bring mine heart to hearken to the Lord.</p>
                  <p>And are [you] come to me again? tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me and enticeing me again after you? what, ſhall I be a Drunkard again? an Earth-worm, an Epicure, and fleſh-pleaſer again? Away, away, I have done with all iniquity, but eſpecially I muſt have an eye to you, I dare not touch with you for my life, and therefore come my ſoul, put on thine armour, ſtand upon thy guard, and reſiſt them. And in ſpecial call up <hi>fear</hi> to thine help, and ſet that for thy Sentinel againſt them.</p>
                  <p>Fear will quickly eſpy, and will give the alarm to the Soul. <hi>Riſe Sampſon, the Philiſtines are upon thee.</hi> Riſe Soul, the Devil is at thy back, ſin lyes at the door; Fear will eſpy, and will not ſlight the danger we are in. <hi>The fleſh</hi> counts ſin a friend, that comes to do it a kindneſs: or if it be apprehended as an enemy, that's like to do the Soul a miſchief, <hi>preſumption</hi> will tell you, the miſchief may not be great; if it make a breach upon thy peace, 'tis but repenting after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and that will make it up; whatever wound it makes upon thy heart, it may ſoon be healed; the beſt that is, may be drawn aſide and yet do well enough.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="319" facs="tcp:103224:149"/>Or if Conſcience ſay, it is not to be made light of, it is a dangerous and deadly enemy, yet <hi>ſecurity</hi> will tell you, the enemy is yet afar off, take thine eaſe, and trouble not thy ſelf before the time. When the tempter is come, 'twill be time enough to look about thee.</p>
                  <p>But now fear will hold ſin in conſtant ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and it will ever ſuſpect the worſt, look to thy ſelf, he is at hand that betrayes thee, ſin lyes at the door watching for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and if it get in once, God knows what miſchief it may do thee, e're ever thou get clear of it.</p>
                  <p>Whatever miſchief ſin hath done to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the world, thy fear will ſuſpect it may do as bad by thee. How many Souls has this pride made to fall into the condemnation of the Devil? How many Souls hath this cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs drown'd in perdition and deſtruction? How many Souls has this evil company led down into the deep? What did <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s pride do by him? why it drove him from men, amongſt the beaſts of the field. How did luſt and luxurie ſerve the prodigal? It fetch'd him out from his fathers houſe, and left him at the Pigs trough. Whether did the rich man's glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony carry him? from the pleaſures of his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the torments of Hell. What kindneſs did <hi>Gehazi</hi>'s bribes do for him? they ſmote him a leper. What advantage did <hi>Achan</hi>'s Gold, <hi>Judas</hi> his Silver, <hi>Ananias</hi> his lye, bring to them? was not death all their wages? yea, it will put it to be conſider'd, what ſin hath done, not only
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:103224:150"/>
to particular perſons, but to Kingdoms and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to Countreys and Cities. what brought it on the whole world? A flood of waters to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them. What on <hi>Sodom?</hi> It burnt it to aſhes. What on <hi>Shiloh?</hi> Deſtruction and Devaſtation. Look to thy ſelf Soul, this ſame enemy that hath made ſuch woful work every where in the world; this very enemy ſtands watching at thy door; every little ſin that comes, thou knoweſt not who, or what may be at its heels: Doſt thou not ſee Sword, and Famine, and Peſtilence following after it! behold the Devil leading on the Van, and Death and Hell bringing up the Rear.</p>
                  <p>O what eaſie admiſſion and entertainment (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this miſchief ſin hath done) do fearleſs Souls ordinarily give unto it? It's ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to come upon them as it will, to lodge with them, and dwell with them, and walk with them. It meets them at every turn, at their Tables, their Beds, in their Shops, in their Fields, and yet it is with them, as if there were no enemy near. If your houſes were haunted with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, you would flee out of them; if you ſaw Death in every cup of exceſs, if you ſaw a toad in every gluttonous diſh, would you not be ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at it, if you ſaw Robbers and Murtherers at your heels, would you not run for it? How is it that you are not running for your lives? Fear and you will run. How is it that you are no more carefully enquiring, which way may I take to eſcape? there's ſuch a ſin, or ſuch a ſin that is upon me every day, how may I get rid of it? Fear, and that will both put you

upon asking, and help you to find out your way to eſcape.</p>
                  <p>But oh how is it, that there ſhould be yet any <hi>pleading for,</hi> or excuſing ſin in the world! ſuch fools there are every where found, who are only afraid of <hi>their friends,</hi> who are watching and fighting againſt <hi>their Remedy;</hi> who fall foul with a friendly admoniſher, with a faithfull reprover; ſo far from taking heed of ſin, that they can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take it well to be bid to take heed of it. Let any one come and ſay to them, Friend, <hi>doſt thou well to be angry?</hi> doſt thou well to be idle and vain, to be thus heady and wilfull in thy way? And it may be inſtead of an [I thank you for your friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly warning] this ſhall be all, [What's that to you? look to your ſelf, and meddle not with me] Shame upon this folly and madneſs. Fear Sin as you ought, and you will never fly in the face of a faithfull reprover.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this direction; if you wil but heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to me in this one thing, ſo fear as to flee Sin, you will at once eſcape all that can hurt you. If I bid you flee from a Serpent, a Cockatrice may meet you; if you flee from the Sword, the Famine may meet you; if you flee from the Famine, the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence may devour you; if you flee from the wrath of Man, the wrath of God may fall on you; onely flee Sin, and you are out of danger for ever.</p>

                     <pb n="306" facs="tcp:103224:151"/>(1.) <hi>For <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers,</hi> who are yet void of the Grace of God, my word to them ſhall be this; <hi>Follow after true and ſaving Grace, in fear of falling ſhort of it. Heb.</hi> 12.15. <hi>Looking dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, leaſt any man fail of the Grace of God.</hi> This Direction hath been in part prevented, in what hath been ſaid in the two former: our ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to get into Chriſt, and to get out of a ſtate of ſin, is the ſame in effect as to ſeek after Grace. What I ſhall adde to what hath been ſaid, ſhall be onely theſe two words.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Let your aim be at Sincerity, and be ſure you take not up with any thing that's ſhort of it.</hi> This, I take it, may fairly be accounted the ſence of that counſel of <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 23.23. <hi>Buy the Truth.</hi> The words may as well be rendred, Buy Truth, or Sincerity; get an upright heart, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it coſt you.</p>
                  <p>Truth is ſometimes taken <hi>objectively,</hi> for the Doctrine of Truth; the true Doctrine of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. Sometimes it's taken <hi>ſubjectively</hi> for Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and Integrity, that Truth in the inward parts, which God loveth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.6. Both may be here intended, but eſpecially the latter. It is pernicious and dangerous to fall ſhort of either, but eſpecially of the laſt. To be falſe to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is more dangerous of the two, than to be of a falſe Religion. An hypocritical Chriſtian is in a worſe caſe than an honeſt Infidel; there is more hope of ſome conſcientious Papiſts, than of licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Proteſtants.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Buy Truth.</hi> Whatever you miſs of, whatever it coſts you, get Sincerity and Uprightneſs. To
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:103224:151"/>
                     <hi>buy</hi> it, here notes, 1. <hi>To make it our own.</hi> Make Religion your own; not only by getting a right Notion of it, a clear underſtanding, wherein the ſincerity of Godlineſs lies, nor barely by holding the truth, and owning it in a bold profeſſion, (there are that hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs) but by getting it formed and engraven upon your hearts, and ſubjecting all your powers to the Authority and Government of it; not only hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Truth, but ſuffering the Truth to take hold of you, and to form you into its own image. This is to make Religion our own. 2. To <hi>buy,</hi> notes, <hi>to make it our own by way of Exchange,</hi> by parting with, and doing away whatſoever is inconſiſtent with it.</p>
                  <p>Buy ſincerity whatever it coſt you; it may coſt you much ere you can get it. It muſt be bought, though not by a price; a price you have not to give; all that you have is not of that value to be a price for Grace. But though you have nothing to buy it with as a Price, yet you have ſomething to part with as a Condition, without which you cannot obtain; all that you have muſt go for it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.33.</p>
                  <p>I have ſpoken much already, to ſhew you wherein Sincerity ſtands; ſtudy well thoſe marks I have laid down, for Chriſtians to prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by, and then propoſe it to your ſelves, never to give over till you are gotten up to that ſpirit and life of Godlineſs, that will abide the trial of thoſe marks: Reſolve to purſue it to the utmoſt, whatever it may coſt thee. If thine Eſtate muſt go for it, let it go; better be poor than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious: if thou muſt loſe thy Friends, bid fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:103224:152"/>
to them all; better be an Abject than an Hypocrite: if thy Name and reputation muſt go, let it go; better be a Reproach than a Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate: if thy ſloth and beloved eaſe muſt go, and it will coſt thee labour and pains, as certainly it will; buckle to thy work, better Labour than eternal Poverty. Stick at no terms, whatever the Lord impoſes, ſubmit to it. Let me have Grace Lord, and let it ſtand me in whatever thou pleaſeſt. Take from me what thou wilt, impoſe on me what thou wilt, only help me to bear and perform, and I am content, ſo that I may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of that Grace which accompanies Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Friends, let me again beſeech and exhort you, thus reſolvedly to follow on after ſincerity and ſoundneſs, and beware you do not conclude you have obtained before you have, and ſo fall ſhort at laſt. Once more let me remember you of what I have already told you, There are preparations for Grace which are not Grace, there are Images of Grace which are not Grace, there is ſomething like Faith and like Repentance, which are not the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Have you ſet out after Chriſt? hath the Lord awakened any of your Souls? is the ſleeping De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil rouz'd, and hath he rais'd ſuch ſtorms as he ſometimes does at his caſting out? Doth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſtirre? hath it worried thee out of thine old ſleep and ſecurity? Hath the great Shepherd ſent forth his dogs, thy fears, after thee, to fetch thee in? and is thy Soul now in motion towards Chriſt? art thou put upon praying, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and conſidering thy wayes, and attempting
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:103224:152"/>
an amendment? Haſt thou thus ſet out after the Lord? O take heed thou take not up thy reſt here, follow on till thou obtain.</p>
                  <p>Friends, 'tis great pity, that any of you ſhould come ſo far, and yet not come thorough, but pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in the way. Take encouragement from what is already done, but take not up your ſtand here: count not this all, and yet do not count it nothing. Man, be of good courage, the Lord who hath brought thee hitherto, hath therein ſaid to thee, as to that Scribe, <hi>Mark</hi> 12.34. <hi>Thou art not far from the Kingdom of God.</hi> O thank God for that word; the next word may be, <hi>The Kingdom of God is within thee.</hi> What within a ſtep of Chriſt? O take courage and put on, one ſtroke further, and thou haſt ſhot the gulf; a little more Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, a little more Labour, and the work may be done. Follow on after the Lord, and hope in God; behold how he cometh, leaping over the Mountains; behold the Father of this poor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal, running to meet his returning Son. The Sun of Righteouſneſs, (behold) is even riſing upon thee; O ſhall the Sun go back, or ſtand ſtill? Cry to the Lord, Ariſe, ſhine upon this dark and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nighted Soul, bring in that light of Life, which is already dawning upon me. O let not Sin and the World, now thou art gotten ſo near, pull thee back or hold thee at the door. Come on, come on poor Soul, the ſalvation of God is near, even ready to be revealed upon thee, the Lord ſtands waiting to be gracious to thee. Whileſt thou canſt not ſay, I have already attained, follow after, and thou ſhalt attain, and apprehend, and be apprehended of Chriſt; I will not ſay as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:103224:153"/>
Stand ſtill,</hi> but go on, and thou ſhalt ſee the ſalvation of God.</p>
                  <p>But yet, as there is hope, ſo there is alſo hazard; thou art ſtill between hope and fear, let both joyn together, and force out thy ſtronger cryes, When Lord? when Lord? I ſee thou haſt dealt graciouſly by others, now one's brought in, then another, but my Soul ſtill ſticks; though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be done, yet how little is it? wo is me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I am but as a Cake half bak'd, half perſwaded, half reſolved; O when ſhall this <hi>almoſt</hi> come up to <hi>altogether?</hi> Shall this be the day, when it ſhall be ſaid, Salvation is come into this heart? O come Lord, when ſo many be taken, let not me be left; when ſo many be brought home, let not me be left at half-way; though I have been ſo long a coming towards thee, I doubt I am not yet come to thee; though I be come to thy door, do I not hitherto ſtand without? Lord take me in, Lord take me in, make me one of thy Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> indeed, in whom there is no guile.</p>
                  <p>Cry thus, lift up each one his Soul, and beg this Grace of the God of Grace. Beg and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, believe and hope, hope and run, and wait for the Salvation of the Lord; but pray in fear, run in fear, wait in fear, leſt after all this, you ſhould fall ſhort of the Grace of God. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Let us therefore fear, leſt a Promiſe being left us, of entring into his reſt, any of you ſhould ſeem to come ſhort of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Take encouragement to ſeek Grace from the Promiſe of obtaining.</hi> Matth. 7.7. <hi>Ask, and it ſhall be given you, ſeek and ye ſhall find, knock
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:103224:153"/>
and it ſhall be opened to you; for every one that asketh receiveth,</hi> &amp;c. Jam. 1.5. <hi>If any of you lack Wiſdom, let him ask it of God, who gives to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it ſhall be given him.</hi> If any man lack Grace, let him ask it; he that will not be a Beggar ſhall ever be poor. Let him ask, and it ſhall be given him; it is not to be had without asking, and it is to be had for the asking. There are four eſpecial Encouragements in this Promiſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Lord <hi>[giveth]</hi> He is not like to him that ſets up himſelf above God, <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> who Sells all he has; God <hi>giveth,</hi> you ſhall have it freely, <hi>without money and without price,</hi> Iſa. 55.1.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>[To all men]</hi> to any man that asks, and asks aright, to the worſt as well as the beſt. Thoſe that need it moſt, if they be duely ſenſible of their need, are moſt like to ſpeed; the emptieſt Veſſels are thoſe that God will fill, the fouleſt Veſſels are thoſe that God will cleanſe; he will give Grace to any (that ſeek it as they ought) to the worſt as well as the beſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>[Liberally]</hi> A drop is more than thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveſt, but if thou wilt, the whole Fountain ſhall be thine; thou, as poor as thou art, mayſt have Grace, and have it in abundance: theſe dry trees, theſe pining and periſhing and ſtarveling Souls, that ſit lamenting your poverty, go to God and you may all have enough; every Veſſel ſhall be filled with the water of Life.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>[And upbraideth not]</hi> he will not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid any man, nor upon any account, that is a ſerious ſuitor to him. 1. He will not upbraid
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:103224:154"/>
any man, <hi>with boldneſs or ſaucineſs.</hi> If a poor man come to a Prince, to beg any great Favour from him, what is his ordinary entertainment? What a ſaucy Fellow is here? here's a bold Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger indeed, get you gone, you are a ſaucy fellow; God will not upbraid any of you ſo, you may come boldly to the throne of Grace. 2. He will not upbraid any man <hi>with his unworthineſs;</hi> Sirrah you are a Rebel, and mine Enemy; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how you have carried it to me; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, you are ſuch a poor and inconſiderable thing, that you are never like to do me much ſervice, if I ſhould give you never ſo much; get you gone: thus men upbraid, but God will not do ſo; he hath gifts for Rebels, Grace for his Enemies, the unworthieſt among them all; he hath put them into the hands of his Son, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to diſtribute amongſt ſuch. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.18. How is it Sinner, that thou haſt gotten no grace all this time? how is it that thou art not yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the throne of Grace, a begging for it? O I am an unworthy wretch, a vile ſinner, a rebell againſt God, ſure he will not look upon ſuch a one as I; No? yes, he will look upon any one that comes, he upbraideth no man. 3. He will not upbraid any man <hi>with coming too often, or asking too much.</hi> He will not ſay as men to Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, Why you were here but yeſterday, my door can never be empty for you. He will not ſay, Can you not be content with a little? will not one Alms ſuffice you? God will rather ſay, why have you ſtay'd ſo long ere you came? why have I heard no ſooner? or why hear I no oftner of you?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="313" facs="tcp:103224:154"/>Go Sinner, ſpeak to the Lord, for that poor graceleſs Soul of thine, beg thy pardon, ask his Grace and Mercy; knock at his door, and lye at his door, take no other anſwer but an Alms; God doth not uſe to ſend away his Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, that will not be deny'd, but ſooner or later he will ſurely give unto them.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) <hi>For Believers,</hi> who have already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Grace in truth, my word to them ſhall be, <hi>Follow on towards perfection, in fear of falling back from, or walking unworthy of that Grace wherein you ſtand.</hi> Haſt thou obtained Grace? haſt thou ſo indeed? May be, now thine heart will be ready to ſay to thee, Fear not, thou art now out of danger of miſcarrying for ever, thou art paſs'd from Death to Life, and ſhalt not come into condemnation. But yet take heed, for,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>If thou be ſo ſecure from condemnation as thou thinkeſt thou art, yet thy Fear is one of thoſe neceſſary Means by which thou muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from it.</hi> As the Apoſtle ſaith concerning Faith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. ſo may we ſay concerning Fear, <hi>We are kept by the mighty power of God</hi> [through Fear] <hi>unto ſalvation.</hi> Conſider that Scripture, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. <hi>I will put my fear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>If thou be indeed ſecur'd from wrath, art thou ſecur'd from ſin alſo?</hi> Is there no fear that ſin may hurt thee, though thou ſhouldſt not die for it? Is there nothing to be feared but Hell? is there no fear but that of a Slave? If thou be a Child of God, is there no fear of diſingenuity and unworthineſs? If thou be his Servant, is
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:103224:155"/>
there no fear of ill husbandry? if thou be his Diſciple, is there no fear of non-proficiency? He hath nothing of Chriſt, that thinks nothing is to be feared, but wrath and damnation.</p>
                  <p>Fear Sin, fear to be unworthy, unthankfull, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull, fear ſinfull decayes, and declinings, and negligences, and in that fear follow on towards perfection. Particularly,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Follow on the work of Mortification, in fear leſt whatſoever wound ſin hath received, it ſhould recover and get head again.</hi> Haſt thou got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it a little under? make it as ſure as thou canſt, though thou haſt gotten over <hi>Jordan,</hi> and haſt ſet thy foot on the banks of <hi>Canaan,</hi> yet the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanite</hi> is ſtill in the land, and will be a briar and thorn unto thee. Thou wilt never have peace, thou wilt never proſper in the Grace of God, but according as thou proſpereſt in thy warre againſt ſin. Doſt thou ever deſign to come to any thing in Religion, and to grow up in the Grace of God? Let thine eye and thine hand be upon this adverſary, which will otherwiſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly keep thee down, and it may be bring thee much lower than thou art this day.</p>
                  <p>'Tis with Grace in an unmortified heart, as with poor <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> 'tis under Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The task-maſters were upon <hi>Iſraels</hi> backs, to keep them in bondage; they were not their own men, to do as they would, they could not go and ſerve the Lord, their tyrants would not ſuffer them: and thus it's like to be with thee. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>When I would do good, evil is preſent with me.</hi> O theſe <hi>Egyptians</hi> have me in hold, I am ſo captivated to the Law of ſin, that I cannot
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:103224:155"/>
do the thing that I would. What an hard ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude am I under? wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me?</p>
                  <p>Onely, betwixt oppreſſed <hi>Iſrael</hi> and this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed <hi>Iſraelite</hi> (the new Creature) there is this difference, <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by how much the more they were oppreſſed, by ſo much the more they grew and multiplyed; 'twas more than all <hi>Egypt</hi> could do to keep them barren. But Grace will never grow and fructifie under the oppreſſion of Sin; Grace oppreſſed <hi>by affliction,</hi> will proſper and grow, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did; Chriſtians are ſeldom in ſuch a thriving ſtate as when under trouble; and that may comfort us under all the oppreſſions of men; we may be as holy under them all, we may ſerve the Lord as well, it may be, better, we may enjoy the Lord as much, it may be more, in our afflicted, than in our proſperous ſtate. But under the tyranny and uſurpation of ſin, Grace cannot thrive; 'twill hardly be kept alive whiles luſt ſo lords it over it.</p>
                  <p>When the poor Soul under this oppreſſion of luſt, groans and cryes, as poor <hi>Iſrael</hi> did, <hi>Let me goe,</hi> let me go, that I may ſerve the Lord; the fleſh poſſibly, when in a fright, (as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did when they were ſmitten with their plagues) may ſay, <hi>Go, go and ſerve the Lord;</hi> be as holy as thou wilt, get thee up out of <hi>Egyt,</hi> get thee on towards Heaven. But then ſhortly after when the fright is over, it falls on again, and it may be, doubles the bondage. Go ſerve the Lord: To your work, ſays the fleſh; or it may be, To your play, you ſhall not go. Or if the Soul hath gotten a little more liberty than ordinary, theſe
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:103224:156"/>
                     <hi>Egyptians</hi> will after it again, <hi>Iſrael</hi> can never get free, and be let alone to ſerve the Lord indeed, till the <hi>Egyptians</hi> be dead.</p>
                  <p>'Tis in vain to hold a treaty with our fleſh, to make terms and to article with it, for a larger allowance; till this enemy be dead, thy Soul will never proſper, nor go comfortably on its way. Get <hi>Egypt</hi> into the Red Sea, let thy Sin be drown'd in that Sea of Blood, the Blood of Chriſt; that's the only Ocean in which Sin will drown and die; when thou haſt it there, then that oppreſſed thing within thee will grow and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe mightily, when Sin is dead, then Grace will thrive.</p>
                  <p>Grace in an unmortified heart, is as a ſpark of fire in green wood, it will not burn, all the blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it up will hardly keep it alive, the ſap and moyſture of the wood will choak it; when the ſticks are dryed, then 'twill burn. O what a flame of holy Affections, what a flame of Love and holy Deſires would break forth! what burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſhining Lights ſhould we be, if theſe green Faggots, our luſts, were dried up and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered? when you are dead to ſin, then you ſhall be alive unto God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.11.</p>
                  <p>Chriſtian, art thou nothing concern'd for that little Grace that's in thee? preſerve it, for it is thy Life; and look upon thy luſts as its Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors and Murtherers, that would ſtrangle the babe in thy womb; and never count thy ſelf ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, till they be dead which ſeek this child's life. Say within thine heart, I go in fear of my life, of them; there's no binding them to the Peace, or the good Behaviour, they are thy mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal

Enemies, and thou canſt have no ſecurity but in their death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But how ſhall I doe to get my ſins morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why, firſt let me ask thee, art thou ſo ſenſible of the evil of them, and the miſchiefs thou art like to ſuffer by them, that thou dareſt not let them live? Art thou ſo heartily afraid of them, that nothing leſs than their death will give thee quiet? Art thou more afraid of thy living luſts, than of the labour and the ſmart that their death will coſt thee? who would bear the cutting off of a limb, an arm or a legge, that is not ſenſible that his life is concerned in it? This mortifying work is one of the moſt painfull works of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; It is not ſo difficult to tell you how you ſhould do it, as to make you willing to doe it. Phyſicians ſometimes have an harder task, to perſwade to the taking of the Phyſick, than to cure the Diſeaſe when once the Patient is willing; and when no other Arguments will prevail, 'tis Fear at laſt that muſt do it. Art thou in ſuch a fear of thy Diſeaſe, that this does ſwallow up thy fear of thy remedy? Art thou for the death of ſin, how painfull ſoever it may be to thee? Why if thou art in good earneſt, then take theſe following Directions:

The irruptions and breakings forth of luſt into action, are as ſo many Iſſues of blood running upon us; the workings of pride, the workings of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, ſenſuality, and the like, are a filthy fluxe, ſo many unclean iſſues, or running ſores upon us. Thoſe that ſport themſelves with their ſins, are as men that make a ſport of their filthy ulcers and unclean diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>Now the way of cure of theſe unclean iſſues, may be illuſtrated from that Scripture. There are three things to be noted in the cure of that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>

                  <p>Friends, would you be healed of your plagues? Go to Chriſt for a cure. Put forth the hand of faith and touch: touch, not the hemme of his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but his ſide and his heart, his hands and his feet; touch this Jeſus as a crucified Jeſus; Chriſt can heal you with a touch, but he will not touch your diſeaſed Souls, unleſs your faith firſt touch him.</p>

                     <pb n="337" facs="tcp:103224:158"/>We read, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. that a look of a ſtung <hi>Iſraelite</hi> (which was the ſame thing with this womans touch) on the brazen Serpent, got out ſuch vertue from him who was ſignified by that Serpent, as cured him of his ſting. Chriſt look'd on by faith, will not only heal thee of the ſting, but will kill the Serpent, that it ſhall never ſmite thee with ſuch a deadly ſting again.</p>
                  <p>Go to Chriſt ſinner, ſay within thy ſelf, If I can but touch him, I ſhall be made whole; look to the brazen Serpent, and both thou ſhalt be healed, and the fiery Serpent ſlain.

It may be even when thou art praying againſt thy pride, thou letſt it feed upon thy very Prayer; thy elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence or affectionate Enlargement, or any thing thou apprehendeſt to be praiſe-worthy, this muſt be meat for thy pride.

as thou art off thy knees, away thou goeſt, to work for the one, or to thy play to pleaſe the other. When ſome of thy laſt words are, <hi>lead us not into temptation,</hi> it may be thy very next ſteps may be running into temptation; this is but mocking of God, and deluding thy ſelf.

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Put a bridle on its Jaws.</hi> My meaning is, reſtrain it from its actings; if thou canſt not prevent its conception, ſtrangle it in the birth; if the fire be kindled within, yet give it no vent: allow not the luſt of thine heart, the priviledge of thy mouth, or the command of thine hand: if thou canſt not reſtrain thy covetous deſires, yet hold in from covetous practices; if thou loveſt the wine and the ſtrong drink, yet withhold the cup from the lip; if thou canſt not ſo eaſily rule thy ſpirit, yet bridle thy tongue; the fire of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion doth not waſte by ſpending, but rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes: the ordinary preventing and reſtraining the acts of ſin, will weaken its habits. I have heard ſome perſons vainly ſpeaking at this rate, when I have anger in mine heart out it muſt, and then I am friends; and ſo take it for their vertue rather than their ſin, that they caſt out all their mire and dirt in a ſtorm, becauſe then a calm fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.

Let that fear be as the foot upon their necks, to prevent their riſing and return upon thee.</p>
                  <p>Well, thus ſet upon ſin, let it be deſtroyed; reward it as it would ſerve thee, and becauſe it will be long a dying, let it be killed all the day long, draw not back thine hand, whil'ſt its life is left in it.</p>
                  <p>O what an advantage will the death of of ſin be to the life of holineſs! when the body of ſin is dead, 'twill ſtink; dead bodies will do ſo, and all the iſſues of it will be noiſome and loathſome to thee. Luſt is never deadly, but when it lives,

and is ſweet and pleaſant; when it dies and ſtinks, and is become an annoyance to thee, it will be the leſs thine hindrance; it hath now done its worſt, the more it offends, the leſs it will hurt.</p>
                  <p>Do'ſt thou find ſin ſweet?

                  <p>The death of ſin is all our diſeaſes cured, the lean and conſumptive Soul will now revive and recover, and be ſtrengthened for its work.

                  <p>Our firſt fruits muſt be brought forth upon our ſelves, our firſt care and buſineſs muſt be, to work out our own Salvation, to keep, every one
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:103224:164"/>
of us, our own vineyard. Thou haſt an heart of thine own to keep, and a tongue to keep, and eyes and hands to look to, and govern well; thou haſt thy thoughts, and thy paſſions, and thine appetite, and thy Conſcience, and thy converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to take care of; and the grace thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, is firſtly to be exerciſed upon thy ſelf. But though thy work begin there, yet it muſt not end there; thou haſt thy family to govern, thou haſt thy father's family, the houſhold of faith, to look after; yea, and thou haſt a larger charge than this, as thou haſt opportunity, do good to all; <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10. thou art ſet to be a guide to the blind, a light to them that are in darkneſs, an inſtructer of the fooliſh, a teacher of babes, an example of the believers; yea, and of the unbelievers alſo, in word, in converſation, in charity, in ſpirit, in faith, in purity.</p>
                  <p>Now Chriſtians, know your work, and ſet to your work; ſerve the Lord with the beſt you have, and ſerve the Lord with all you have; and all this in fear, leſt you ſhould receive the grace of God in vain. I beſeech you, ſaith the Apoſtle, take heed of that, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1. <hi>I beſeech you, that you receive not the grace of God in vain.</hi> Then the grace of God is received in vain, not only, when nothing is done by it, but in a degree it may be ſaid to be received in vain, when its fruits are not proportionable, there is not ſo much done as might have been done: When he that hath received ten talents, brings forth no more fruit than might have been brought forth with five; when he that hath received five ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, hath done no more good, than might have
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:103224:164"/>
been done with two; all our receivings that are over and above the proportion of our fruits, all the over-plus of them, is received in vain. He that is a knowing Chriſtian, if he lives not to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter purpoſe, than a Chriſtian of little knowledge; he that is an ancient experienced Chriſtian, if he be no more uſeful in his life, than he that is but a babe, that which he hath received above what this babe hath received, is received in vain, and the Lord may ſay to him, wherefore is this waſte?</p>
                  <p>What, art thou a man of knowledge, and haſt had ſuch long acquaintance with God, and ſuch experiences of his ſpecial love and kindneſs to thee, and do'ſt thou keep all ſo much to thy ſelf, that thou art of little more uſe in thy generation, than a child? Hath the Lord taken thee into his heart, ſhewed thee his loves, comforted thee in Prayer, counſelled thee in his Word, feaſted thee at his Table, cauſed his grace ſo to abound to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee, and made thee glad with the light of his countenance, and all for no more but this? hath he furniſhed thee, and fitted thee for every good work, and yet art thou thus barren and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful? An unuſeful and unactive ſpirit in a Chriſtian, is an unhappineſs, and an unworthineſs, which yet poſſibly ſome that are none of the loweſt form for attainments, may have reaſon enough to charge themſelves withall; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that though they have not altogether, yet they have very much received the grace of God in vain.</p>
                  <p>Brethren beloved, let us ſtudy, and let us learn that wiſdom which is from above, which is full
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:103224:165"/>
of good fruits, dare not to be found among the barren of the flock, nor of thoſe trees which do little better than cumber the ground. Once more let me put the ſpur to the ſide: What if the Lord ſhould come among his fig-trees, and find ſo little fruit upon thee? art thou not afraid, thou might'ſt hear that word, <hi>Cut it down, why cumbreth it the ground?</hi> Conſider friend, what fruits are there found upon thee? the fruits of the fleſh, may be, are ſtill hanging on; what cluſtres are there of them? hatred, variance, emulation, ſtrife, wrath, envying, pride, covetouſneſs, what a vintage is there of theſe wild grapes? but where are the fruits of the ſpirit? what a ſmall gleaning is there of them to be found, and what ſhrivelings are thoſe that are? would'ſt thou that thy Lord ſhould find it thus with thee? we read <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.16. when the Church was in a thriving fruitful ſtate, ſhe prayed, <hi>Let my beloved come into his Garden, and eat his pleaſant fruits.</hi> Do'ſt Thou make that Prayer? O no, I am afraid he ſhould come and find me thus; thy Prayer is more like to be, <hi>Let my Lord delay his coming.</hi> But how long muſt he ſtay? thine heart would ſhake within thee, to think that he ſhould find thee thus; but when, O when ſhall it be better with thee? Take this pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hook (fear will ſerve thee for ſuch an uſe) and lop off theſe evil fruits, that the fruits of righteouſneſs may ſpring up in their room. When ſhall the Roſes and the Pomegranates bud? when ſhall the fragrant ſpices flow forth? thoſe bleſſed fruits of the Spirit, <hi>love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſs, goodneſs, faith, meekneſs, temperance,</hi> when ſhall theſe ſprout once?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="351" facs="tcp:103224:165"/>Chriſtians, do you not wiſh 'twere better with you? can you bear your own barrenneſs? Is not this vain, empty, fruitleſs life an offence to you? do you not confeſs 'tis low water with you? do you not complain of your uſeleſsneſs and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs? But ſhall this be all? ſhall we never have better fruit to bring before the Lord, but our confeſſions and complaints of our want of fruit, but our ſelf-bemoanings, and ſelf-judgings for our barrenneſs? Better this, than nothing, but when ſhall it be better? when ſhall we hear the voice of joy, and praiſe, and thankſgivings to the Lord, for bleſſing our fields with increaſe? when ſhall we be able to ſay, See O Lord, thy blood hath not been ſhed in vain? thy ſpirit hath not been poured out upon me in vain? Behold the winter is paſt, and the ſpring comes on; the flowers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, the fig tree putteth forth, and the vines with the tender grapes give a goodly ſmell; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the fruits of that bleſſed blood and ſpirit in the reviving of this dead heart, in the fructifying of this barren heart. My Soul make thy boaſt of God; though I have nothing of mine own, but what I loath and am aſham'd of; yet here's, through rich mercy, ſomething of his fruits I have brought forth; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me, and his grace hath not been beſtowed on me in vain.</p>
                  <p>Come on thou withering Soul, cry out with the Spouſe, <hi>Awake thou North-wind, and come thou South, blow upon my Garden:</hi> let the Spirit of the Lord breath upon me, that <hi>my Spices may flow forth,</hi> and my fruits may appear; and then thou mayeſt go on, now <hi>let

my beloved come into his Garden, and eat his pleaſant fruits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I cannot enumerate the particular fruits that you ſhould bring forth, they are all the fruits of righteouſneſs; but in hope that after all that hath been ſaid, your fear of being found among the barren, may prepare you to receive ſome farther inſtruction for your growth, and fructifying in every good work: I ſhall only lay before you ſeven things, which if they be in you and abound, will make you that ye ſhall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.

O that I could forſake this world, and crucifie this fleſh, and follow God, and walk worthy of the Goſpel in all things; thus they may wiſh, and deſire, but for their hearts they cannot come to it; they cannot bring forth their wiſh into a will, nor their will into performance.
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:103224:166"/>
The leaſt child of God hath more of the power of God in him, than the moſt knowing and the very beſt of natural men: all the parts and vertues of a natural man, do fall as much ſhort (as to this ſpiritual vital power) of the leaſt of Saints, as a dead man does of a living child.</p>
                  <p>But yet, where there is grace in the beginnings of it, in compariſon of what it may grow to, its power may be ſmall, and its ſtrength may be but weakneſs. How great is the power of the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy above the ſickly and faint? how much is the power of a man above the power of an infant? 'Tis well thou art alive, but wilt thou ſtill be but a child? O what weakly Souls are many amongſt the living Souls! How ordinary is this complaint, <hi>To will is preſent with me, but how to perform I find not.</hi> O how many fruſtraneous attempts, and ineffectual offers do we make at an holy fruitful life; we wiſh for more care, and more diligence, and more uſefulneſs; but ſtill we fall ſhort, we are reaching towards, but cannot reach to it. We judge our ſelves for our failings, we groan under our imperfect duties, we are ſick of thoſe corruptions that are mingled with them, but we cannot overcome them; we lament our barrenneſs, we hunger and thirſt after more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and yet we cannot obtain: we cannot do the good that we would, we cannot forbear to do the evils that we would not; ſo weak is our heart, that though we can weep over our falls, and fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, yet we cannot amend them.</p>
                  <p>But art thou not afraid to continue thus? what if death ſhould overtake thee thus? how would'ſt thou dye, when thy ſin is ſo much alive? yea,

how canſt thou live in any peace, whil'ſt thou ſeeſt thou liveſt to ſo little purpoſe? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Brethren, let me exhort you in the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Be ye ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.</hi> Put forth the power that you have receiv'd, &amp; truſt on God for more. Put forth that power that you have, &amp; thats the way to encreaſe your ſtrength. Do not make your ſelves to be weaker than you are; ſay not, 'tis for want of power, that 'tis no better with you, when 'tis for want of care and induſtry; much more certainly might be done, if we were better Stewards of what we have: Let there not be a pretence of weakneſs to excuſe your lazineſs; do what thou canſt, thou canſt do more than thou do'ſt; and if indeed thy ſtrength be but ſmall, thou knoweſt whether to go for more. Study well, and lay hold on that word, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.28, 29.31. <hi>Haſt thou not known? haſt thou not heard, that the everlaſting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth fainteth not, neither is weary? —He giveth power to the faint, and to them that have no might, he increaſeth ſtrength.—They that wait on the Lord, ſhall renew their strength, they ſhall mount up with wings as the Eagles, they ſhall run and not be weary, they ſhall walk and not be faint.</hi> Chriſtians, let it not ſuffice you, that you are men of underſtanding and good affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, get a Spirit of power, as well as of love and of a ſound mind.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Activity.</hi> An unactive ſpirit is next to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence. Awaken from thy liveleſs wretchleſs temper; put away ſloth thou ſluggard, wilt thou ſtill be a drone? this drone hath a ſting, thine

own Soul will feel it, ſooner or later, that thy ſloth will ſting thee to the heart.</p>
                  <p>Chriſtians, let it appear, that the ſpirit of the living God is in you, by your ſprightfulneſs and vivacity. Shall the evil ſpirit be the only active ſpirit? ſhall ſinners flow forth in vanity and wickedneſs, ſhall their filthy waters be ſuch a quick and running ſtream, and ſhall the waters of the Sanctuary, be but as a ſtanding pool? Be bent for holy action, be prepared and ready for every good work. It's ſaid <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.10. that Chriſtians are <hi>created unto good works:</hi> in the very make and conſtitution of the new creature, we may read its uſe and end; we are new made, for this very end and purpoſe, we are adopted and prepared for an active uſeful life, for thoſe good works which God hath ordained that we ſhould walk in them. Thou had'ſt need ſtir up thy ſelf, and put thy ſelf on, leſt thou quickly come to queſtion, whether thou be a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or no, if thou continueſt ſo backward, and unready to that, for which the new creature is.</p>
                  <p>Haſt thou grace indeed? blow off the aſhes from that living coal, that it may burn and ſhine out in a gracious life. Fire it the moſt active of all the elements, it will not be incloſed, but will find a vent for its flames; ſure thou haſt little of that divine fire in thine heart, that canſt ſo eaſily keep it within.</p>
                  <p>O what wonders are ſluggiſh Chriſtians! Life without motion, Fires that burn not, Suns ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill, Souls condens'd into the gravity of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſſes, the winged Spirits become as the creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things of the earth; when ſhall theſe immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal

ſparks recover and come to themſelves? Chriſtians be impatient with theſe your ſlothful hearts; let there be no ſleep in your eyes, till your ſleepy Souls be awakened. Be aſham'd that you who talk, what God hath done for you, ſhould have no more to ſay of what you have done, or are ready to do for him. Set every wheel in motion, and thereby fit them for more eaſie motion, let them ſtand no longer ſtill; fear, leſt your ruſt ſhould eat out all your ſtrength. Be henceforth for an active life; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think the time, that hath been run out in ſleep, and now awaken and begin to live in good earneſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Severity, or ſtrict and painful holding our ſelves to our rule. Chriſtians muſt be men of action, but they muſt not act wildly or looſely, and at all adventures, but their actions muſt be regular, they muſt be punctual and ſtrict to their rule. Chriſt's commands, ſome of them are hard ſayings, and will put the fleſh hard to it; but whatever they be, they muſt be ſubmitted to, Matth. 28.20. <hi>Teaching them to obſerve [all things] whatſoever I have commanded you.</hi> As Chriſt is ſevere in his impoſitions upon us, ſo Chriſtians muſt be ſevere in their impoſitions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves, and muſt not abate to themſelves a title of their hardeſt duty. Chriſtians muſt be rigid; to be rigid in the way of any party of them that are, or that call themſelves Chriſtians, is an evil. A rigid Presbyterian, a rigid Independent or Anabaptiſt, are ſuch in the wrong of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: but it is a duty, and an excellency to be a ſtrict and rigid Chriſtian; provided, that our rigor be more to our ſelves and to our own fleſh, than to all the world beſides.</p>

                     <pb n="357" facs="tcp:103224:168"/>Now to bring you to this Severity, let me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you to theſe three things.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Fear to be offended at the ſeverities of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Bleſſed is he that ſhall not be offended in me, Matth.</hi> 11.6. The fear of Chriſtian ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is that which keeps back many a Soul from Chriſt. A Chriſtian! who that underſtands what 'tis to be a Chriſtian, will ever be able to bear it? 'Tis too hard ſervice for me to yield my ſelf to; to put my ſelf under ſuch a Law, as ties me up ſo ſhort, from all that mine heart deſires, and holds me ſo cloſe to things ſo contrary to me, how can I endure it? The attempting an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal change, of the ſcope, the cuſtoms, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and the whole way of my life, how griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous are the thoughts hereof? the matter of my deſign, the nature of my work, the temper of my ſociety, to whom I muſt joyn my ſelf, being all ſpiritual and heavenly, how contrary are they to me? The forſaking my Friends and Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the abandoning my pleaſures, the bounding my liberty, the bridling mine Appetite and Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the laying a law upon my ſenſes, the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every word of my mouth, and every thought of mine heart, the holding my ſelf on by line

and by rule, in a way of conſtant painfull duty, without any allowance of the leaſt turning aſide, to the right hand or the left, no though it were to the ſaving of my life, who can with patience think of it? All theſe things are againſt me. How many Souls have there been in the World, whom ſuch forethoughts of Chriſtianity have kept back from Chriſt, and held under the power of the Devil?</p>
                  <p>But though it doth not prevail thus far upon thee, thou wilt adventure after Chriſt however, though thou doſt not ſay in thine heart, this yoke is not to be born, and ſo throw it away, yet poſſibly thou mayſt ſay, 'tis hard to be born, and think much of it, that leſs might not ſuffice: Thou wilt yield to it in the general, but too often when it comes to be a Caſe, that thou thy ſelf art put harder than ordinary to it, thy fleſh flings, and throwes, and murmurs, and thou art for the time ready to bethink, and repent of thy Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. Hath it never been thus with thee? Fear leſt it ſhould, and ſtill remember, <hi>Bleſſed is he that ſhall not be offended in me.</hi> That is, not ſo only as not to renounce me, but not ſo much as to complain or groan, or drive heavily under me. <hi>Good is the Word of the Lord,</hi> that's a word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the heart and tongue of a Diſciple.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Fear to baulk any of the ſeverities of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> 'Tis one thing to ſay, (even in the heart) <hi>Good is the Word of the Lord,</hi> and another thing to ſubmit chearfully to it, when it comes to the pinch.

<pb n="359" facs="tcp:103224:169"/>
and ſcourgings, or Penances, going barefoot, or in ſordid and vile raiment, as 'tis uſed in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but by ſeverity, I mean, ſtrictneſs and exactneſs to our Rule, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever pain or prejudice it may coſt us, or expoſe us to. Our holding our ſelves cloſely to every duty, in ſpecial to thoſe harder duties, of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyal and mortification; the taming of our fleſh, the beating down our bodies, and bringing them in ſubjection, by temperance and neceſſary abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence; thoſe ungratefull duties, admoniſhing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving, withdrawing from offenders, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever elſe our Lord hath impoſed upon us. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, there is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Severity in impoſing upon our ſelves;</hi> when we are not <hi>partial in the Law,</hi> taking only Chriſts eaſier words, and leaving out the harder, but do charge our whole duty upon our ſelves; and when we do not deal too gently or remiſſely with our ſelves, onely telling our hearts, this is thy duty, and it would be good for thee to obſerve it, but do deal more cloſely, and charge it home; See to it, O my Soul, that thou keep the charge of the Lord; It muſt be done, dare not for thy life to favour thy ſelf, or ſpare thy fleſh, by neglecting thy duty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Severity in obſerving and performing our whole Duty.</hi> When we are not onely, not like the Scribes and Phariſees, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.4. <hi>Who bind heavy burthens, and lay them on other mens ſhoulders,</hi> no nor ſuch as bind heavy burthens for our own ſhoulders, and yet not touch them with one of our fingers; but whatever Conſcience bids us do, that we obſerve and do. 'Tis one thing
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:103224:170"/>
to lay good Lawes, and preſcribe good Rules to our ſelves, and another thing to obſerve them. We muſt yoke our ſelves to our work, and go on diligently under the yoke. We muſt not only not quarrel with our rules, as too ſtrait for us, but keep touch with them, and not indulge our ſelves the leaſt ſwerving from them. Some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors there are whoſe Religion is all in their Rules, and their Rules they have only in their Books or their heads, and but little in their hearts; who would be excellent Chriſtians, if their lives were according to what they preſcribe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. When they are in ſecret upon their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering work, they propoſe holy Rules, and make good decrees: oh if they were but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, what Chriſtians would they be; but when they come abroad their Rules are left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them, and it may be never remembred, till they return to their Cloſets again; O what a difference is there, betwixt the ſame perſons in their Cloſets, and in the Fields or Markets? Friends, they are not ſtrait rules, but ſtrict practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that our Lord requires.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Severity in reckoning.</hi> When we make every day a Judgement day, and reckon with our ſelves as God will reckon with us, <hi>ſtrictly. God will bring every work to Judgement.</hi> Of <hi>every idle word men muſt give an account.</hi> Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſins, ſmaller faults, our commiſſions, and our omiſſions, the matters of fact, and the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of them muſt be reckoned up. Nothing muſt ſlip our reckonings, but what hath ſlipt our memories, and we muſt keep that Regiſter care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
                  <p n="4">

                  <p>Such a ſtrict and punctual courſe as this, hath a formidable aſpect, not only to ſinners, but even to ſome of the ſincere weaklings among Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. But however it looks, baulk it not, nor any part of it. Will you pinch upon Conſcience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that would pinch upon the fleſh? will you deny Chriſt, rather than deny your ſelves? Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhuffling or ſhifting off a known Duty, is a degree of denying of Chriſt. Haſt thou given [thy ſelf] unto Chriſt, and wilt thou deny him any thing he will have of thee? Muſt this fleſh be ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his cauſe, who ſpared not his Life for thee? Did he ſay, 'tis too hard to obey, 'tis too hard to ſuffer, 'tis too hard to die, may not leſs than my Blood, than my Soul ſerve their turns? And yet wilt thou ſay, 'Tis too hard to ſerve him, 'tis too hard to live wholly to him, may nothing leſs than all I have ſerve, may not ſomething, may not a little ſuffice him? This fleſh will be like enough to ſay ſo, 'tis too hard, 'tis too much that Chriſt requires, ſomething may be ſpared to my eaſe, to my appetite, to my credit, and will grumble and murmure, if it may not. But ſhall thy Soul ſay, after this ſaying of thy fleſh?</p>
                  <p>Doth thy Soul ſay, 'Tis but reaſon that Chriſt ſhould have all, 'tis but reaſon that Chriſt alone
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:103224:171"/>
ſhould be ſerved, and ſerved in every thing, and to the utmoſt that he requires? It is beſt for me, that I be wholly his, the very ſeverities of Chriſt will be better to me, than the liberties of the fleſh; the pains of Chriſtianity, than the pleaſures of Sin; let me have the wearineſs of the Saints, rather than the eaſe of Sinners; let the yoke of Chriſt wring, rather than be thrown off? Doth not thy Reaſon and thy Conſcience ſpeak thus in thee, and yet muſt the grudgings and repinings of the fleſh carry it?</p>
                  <p>Chriſtians, if it be better to be a Diſciple of Chriſt than a ſtranger, if it be better to be a cloſe and a thorow-pac'd Diſciple, than to bungle and halt, if it be the ſtrictneſs of Chriſtianity, out of which its ſweetneſs growes (the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act conformity, the more ſweet communion with Chriſt) if there be meat in all his work, and his hardeſt work be the moſt ſavoury meal, then O why do we ſo wrong our ſelves, by keeping aloof and following him by halves, taking up with the eaſier parts, and ſlinking away from that which is more difficult, and thereby feeding onely on the husk and ſhell of Chriſtianity, leaving the kernel to thoſe that will be ſo wiſe as to take pains for it.</p>
                  <p>Friends, ſhall we yet be for ſtrictneſs? will you reſolve, will you venture upon it? who are there of you that will yet be perſwaded to follow after the Lord? that will be exact Conformiſts? that will be cloſe Diſciples, punctual Chriſtians, punctual in your words, punctual in your practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whoſe hearts ſhall ſay now according to the Apoſtles words, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.27. <hi>My Converſation

                  <p>O that there were ſuch an heart in us! But O the fearfull heart, O the ſluggiſh heart that we ſtill feel within us. O theſe poor and low ſpirits, that have no ambition for the excellencies of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and cannot bear its difficulties. What a pitifull maimed thing is the Religion of many Profeſſors? how little is there in it? what eaſie, lazy, ſleepy Diſciples are they? how unequal are their ſpirits, how uneven their goings, how weak are their hearts, how ſlow are their motions Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venwards, and how often do they ſtep aſide, to ſave themſelves from labour or trouble? Never a little hotter ſervice is in ſight, but their fleſh calls them off, and away they go preſently after it. When is it that that voice is heard within thee, <hi>Pity thy ſelf, ſpare thy ſelf,</hi> but it does prevail? Such a word, <hi>It is not for mine eaſe, it is not for my credit, or it is not ſafe for me,</hi> what a mighty charm is it, to ſtill and countermand the loudeſt calls of Chriſt and Conſcience?</p>
                  <p>But conſider friend, whoſe voice is it that ſpeaks thus to thee? why whoſe voyce was it that ſpake the like words to Chriſt, when he ſpake of his ſufferings, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.22. <hi>Be it far from thee Lord, this ſhall not be unto thee;</hi> Pity thy ſelf, Maſter, and let it not be thus unto thee: whoſe voice was this? Chriſt tells us whoſe in the next words, <hi>Get thee behind me Sathan:</hi> 'twas the Devil that ſpake thus, by <hi>Peter</hi>'s mouth; and 'tis this ſame Devil that by the mouth of thy
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:103224:172"/>
fleſh, ſpeaks the like to thee. Why man, art thou afraid to hearken to Chriſt, and art thou not afraid to hearken to the Devil?</p>
                  <p>Beloved, we are few of us ſo much Chriſtians, as to be able to endure hardneſs, and therefore 'tis we are ſo eaſily and ſo often called off. Well, but however, as little as we have attained, let us put on after it. Inure your ſelves to hardneſs, and that's the way to endure it. Be ſevere a while, and you will be the better able to bear ſeverity; Fear in good earneſt, how you ever again baulk a Duty, and after a while you will finde, that the hardeſt Duty is not to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

If the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities of his ſervice, be to thee <hi>a ſtumbling-ſtone,</hi> the wrath of the Lamb will be <hi>a mill-ſtone;</hi> if this ſtone fall upon thee, it will grind thee to powder, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.44.</p>
                  <p>Sinners let their tongues run at a wild rate, I muſt have my eaſe, I muſt have my liberty, I was never in bondage, and cannot now endure it, to come under ſuch a ſevere reſtraint: But thou that profeſſeſt thy ſelf to be one of his Diſciples, wilt thou ſay as theſe ſay, I cannot bear it, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure it? Canſt thou burn? what thinkeſt thou of the everlaſting ſeverity? Conſider what thou doſt, either ſubmit to Chriſts Paſtoral Rod,

                  <p>Why is this the caſe? muſt I bow or burn? muſt I come under his Government, or be ground under his Milſtones?

Epheſ. 6.6. <hi>Ye have obeyed from the heart,</hi> Rom. 6.17. <hi>My Son give me thy heart,</hi> Prov. 23.26. What is it to give God the heart? This is one thing comprehended in it, to give him the heart <hi>for a ſervant,</hi> or to ſerve him with the heart. He that gives God the heart, gives him the beſt he hath, and gives him all he hath; the heart will command the tongue, and the hands, and the time, and the Eſtate, to be all at his ſervice; which way the heart goes all goes. Serving the Lord with the heart, is ſerving him in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt; we do but play with duty, we do but mock God, where the heart is not; 'tis only ſerving him in ſpirit, that is ſerving him in truth.</p>
                  <p>Friends be real, and in good earneſt in what you doe: let all your Religion come deep, let your Prayers and your Prayſes, and all the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing your ſelves to Godlineſs of life, be the ſtreamings and iſſuings forth of your hearts to the Lord. Whatever you doe, do it heartily as unto the Lord. Serve the Lord, as you have been uſed to ſerve your fleſh, in good earneſt. What you have done for your Eſtates, what you have done for your Names, or for your ſafety, you have done it heartily, and ſhall that only which we do for God, and for our Souls, be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an heart? what is God? what are our Souls and the concernments of them, that they ſhould be thus put off? Is this heartleſs ſervice all that God is worthy of? will he accept it at our hands, or is it no matter whether he accept it or no? Is this ſpiritleſs ſervice anſwerable to the worth of our Souls, and the weight of Eternity? will you venture all upon ſhadowes and lyes? Are
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:103224:173"/>
we but in Jeſt, when we talk of a God, or a Chriſt, or a World to come Are our hopes and fears about hereafter, but deluſions and dreams? Do you believe from the heart, and dare you not obey from the heart? How can you ſay, you believe there is a God indeed, that of a very truth there is ſuch an Heaven, and ſuch an Hell, in one of which your immortal Souls muſt dwell for ever? how can you believe ſuch things, and not feel your very inwards, even all the Powers of your Souls, engaged about them? Am I ſpeaking to thoſe that believe not, is it not to you that believe, that I now direct my words? Conſider friends The God in whom you believe, is a Spirit, and will be ſerved in Spirit and in Truth; God is a great God, and infinitely worthy of the beſt, and of all you have; your Souls are precious, eternal Life and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Death are ſerious things, and which of theſe two will be your lott, is a ſerious queſtion; and ſure theſe moſt ſerious things, do call for your moſt ſerious and hearty attendance upon them. Away with all guile and hypocriſie, provoke not the jealous God, fool not away your Souls by truſting to lyes. Worſhip God in the Spirit, lift up your Souls in your Prayers, chaſten your Souls in your Faſtings.</p>
                  <p>And as your Souls muſt be in your Lips, in your Eyes, in your Ears, while you are ſolemnly worſhipping of God, ſo let your Hearts be in you Hands too, in all that you have to doe. Let your heart have an hand in all the actions of your lives. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.10. <hi>Whatever thine hand findeth to doe, do it with thy might;</hi> that is, do

it with all your heart; the heart is the might of the man. God is the ſtrength of the heart, and the heart is the ſtrength of the man.</p>
                  <p>Sinners, when they go forth upon ſervice for the Devil, they carry their heart in their hands. <hi>Micah</hi> 7.3. <hi>They do evil with both hands, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly.</hi> [Earneſtly,] there's the heart in their hands. They do their worſt that God will ſuffer them. <hi>Thou haſt done iniquity, as thou couldeſt, Jer.</hi> 3.5. as much as ever thou wert able. As Sinners do their worſt, ſo let Chriſtians do the beſt they can.</p>
                  <p>Whatever thou haſt to do <hi>for thine own Soul,</hi> by gathering in, and treaſuring up againſt the time to come, do the moſt and the beſt thou canſt; be as hearty in laying up treaſure in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as ever thou haſt been in laying up treaſure on Earth. Whatever ſervice thou haſt to do <hi>for God in thy generation,</hi> by doing good to others, do it with all thine heart. In your inſtructing, admoniſhing, counſelling, reproving; in your working righteouſneſs, in your ſhewing mercy; in your promoting and encouraging any good work, or preventing evil; in your propagating ſerious Religion, in your pulling poor ſinners as brands out of the burning, and reſcuing them out of the power of the Devil, in compelling the ſtragling and wandring Sheep into the Fold of the Lord, or whatever elſe you have before you, do it heartily as unto the Lord.</p>
                  <p>What a world of good might a generation of hearty Chriſtians do in the World? how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Souls might be the better for them? how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Families might bleſs God for them? The

bleſſing of Souls ready to periſh, might come upon them; they may be the bleſſings of a whole Countrey; they may be Lights to the World, and Life to the dead; Eyes to the blind, Tongues to the dumb, Feet to the lame, and ſtrength to them that have no might; the Kingdom of God, the Goſpel of Chriſt, would be advanced and adorned by them, and the Synagogues of Sathan even depopulated and deſtroyed. And how great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would this both abound to their own account, and tend to their own improvement in the Grace of God?</p>
                  <p>But wo to many of us, yea and to the poor world alſo, becauſe an excuſe muſt ſerve us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of an heart, (we want time, we want parts; either opportunity or ability we have not; thus we talk, when 'tis an heart only that's wanting.)

An ingenuous Chriſtian doth not only ſerve the Lord really, and without guile, but readily and cheerfully; it's ſweet to him to do good: he bears good will to God for himſelf: he feels the infinite goodneſs and worthineſs of the Lord to melt and draw forth his Soul towards him: the name and honour of God is in his heart, and is ſo dear and precious to him, that he feels ſomething within him, prompting him to all manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of love and duty to him. He is become good natur'd, and ſo not only in point of grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, he returns love for love, good will for good will, duty for kindneſs, which he hath received; but it is a pleaſure to him, to return good will for goodneſs, love for his worthineſs to be beloved. The name of God he would have to be above every name; it is his delight, and therefore his deſire, that as the Lord is infinitely honourable, ſo he ſhould be abundantly honoured; the very thing, the magnifying and exalting the Lord, is the great thing that ſits upon his heart, it is a pleaſure to him that God is pleaſed, and this he loves that God ſhould be loved and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and hence is his care, hence are his labours, this is the ſpring-head of all his duties, and God is the Ocean into which his ſtreams do run. He ſpeaks for God, and works for God, and lives for God; he ſtudies to be holy and righteous, he
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:103224:175"/>
is buſie and induſtrious, he is watchful and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and fruitful in good works, that he may thereby ſhew forth the vertues of him that hath called him, and glorifie his Father which is in Heaven. He underſtands and feels, that what he thus does for God, is to himſelf alſo, and will abound to his own account and everlaſting bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the good will he bears to his own Soul, and the hopes he has of his own reward, are as oyl to his wheels, but his good will to his God, is the main ſpring that ſets them all a going: O follow after this bleſſed frame, get you ſuch an ingenuous Spirit, and then how ſweet and eaſie will the very ſeverities of Religion be?

Not but that there may be ſtill ſome uſe of it, more or leſs; ſo long as there is ſin before us, and any danger of our falling into it, ſo long will love cauſe us to fear; but as we are more grown up above the power of ſin, and are not ſo greatly in danger of it, ſo fear abates. By how much the more perfect love, by ſo much the more hatred of ſin, and ſo much the leſs fear of it.

                  <p>When we are become more ſpiritual, we ſhall ſavour and reliſh ſpiritual things, and then ſhall we feel what attractives they will be; our deſires will be above, our delights will be above, our hearts will be loſt to theſe carnal things, we ſhall leave this earth to earthly minds; when this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of fleſh is fallen off, and we are gotten up into the Chariots of fire, then ſhall we ride upon the high places of the Heavens, and our wings ſhall carry us on ſwiftly, towards the mountains of Spices.</p>

That which follows, will be of this uſe to you, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage you to bear the rougher conduct of fear, all along your younger time, by that ſweeter courſe you ſhall have of it, when fear ſhall give up to love; as the pleaſures that comes in, from the hopes of freedom, doth allay and ſweeten the the ſeverities of an apprenticeſhip.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Religion hath its pleaſure.</hi> It hath its tartneſs, and its trouble, as you have ſeen already; ſo much unpleaſantneſs it hath in its fore view, that fooliſh Sinners ſhun it, and run away from it, for fear. They will not touch the Roſes, for fear of the prickles. As 'tis with Saints, ſo 'tis with Holineſs, 'tis <hi>a Lilly among</hi> thorns; theſe thorns

                  <p>Well, but whatever there be in Religion to affright, it hath much more to invite us to it; <hi>Her wayes are wayes of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths are peace,</hi> Prov. 36.17. <hi>They ſhall be abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſatisfied, with the fatneſs of thine houſe, and thou ſhalt make them drink of the River of thy pleaſures,</hi> Pſal. 36.8. what, and how great the pleaſures of Religion are, will be made appear in the third particular.</p>

'tis not every one, that hath a little Religion, that is gotten down ſo deep, as its pleaſure lyes. It is with the pleaſure of Religion, as with the Plagues of Sinners, they both lye at the bottom. The beſt of ſin is at top, Sinners firſt draughts are the ſweeteſt, when they have drank down to the bottom of their cup, then they taſte the dregs. Beware Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, of what comes after thy pleaſant dayes; thou haſt yet taſted but the beſt of Sin, thou art not come to the bottom of thy cup, there the gall and the wormwood lyes.</p>
                  <p>And ſo on the other ſide, the top, and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of Godlineſs, hath more harſhneſs in it, 'tis the inſide and the bottom of it, that is moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, there its ſweetneſs lyes.</p>

Behold, for peace they have great bitterneſs, for eaſe wearineſs, for mirth heavineſs. If Chriſtians that are come but to the entry of Chriſt, ſhould hope for no more than they taſte or ſee, they would be ready to wiſh themſelves back in the tents of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>It is really a bleſſed exchange that they make, who with <hi>Moſes,</hi> Heb. 11.25. chooſe the afflictions of Religion, rather than the pleaſures of ſin. The very ſufferings of the Saints, are a better portion, than the rejoycings of Sinners, the Winter of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs hath more Sun-ſhine, than the Summer of Sin; honeſt poverty is better than the Mammon of unrighteouſneſs, and honeſt labour and travail, than wicked eaſe and idleneſs. He whoſe carnal laughter is turn'd into Godly ſorrow, his ſorrow will end in Godly joy.</p>
                  <p>This joy, though the entrance of Godlineſs be the way to it, yet the Infants in Religion, do ſeldom taſte of it.

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The pleaſure of Sincerity.</hi> Sincerity hath ſuch ſweetneſs in it, as no man knows but he that hath it; <hi>a ſtranger ſhall not intermeddle with this joy.</hi> This pleaſure is not known by every Chriſtian, that is ſincere. Where is ſincerity in every real Chriſtian, but he hath little of the pleaſure of it, that hath not the knowledge of it. Weak Chriſtians are in doubt, whether they be ſincere or not: thoſe that are but one degree above hypocrites, are ſtill in fear that they are but hypocrites; they that know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upright, can rejoyce with that joy of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. <hi>This is our rejoycing, the teſtimony of our Conſcience, that in all ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and Godly ſincerity, we have had our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in the world.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="380" facs="tcp:103224:180"/>O the galls and ſtings of a guileful heart! whatever ſpecious ſhews there may be, of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion without, whatever approbation, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe the hypocrite may obtain from men; whatever tickling delight, in a great repute, for an eminent Chriſtian, he may feel for a while; whatever pleaſure his gifts and commendable performances, may feed him with; yet the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of hypocriſie, and guile within, after the fluſh of that carnal pleaſure is over, will ſting him into bitterneſs and anguiſh. Much good may do hypocrites, with all their applauſes and ſelf-exaltations, a plain, honeſt, upright heart, hath more ſerenity and ſweetneſs, than comes in by all the admirings and Euge's in the world.</p>
                  <p>Friends, would you live a voluptuous life? get you an upright heart: would you have all within you to be ſweetneſs? beware of the leaven of hypocriſie: would you prove your ſelves no hypocrites? then be improving daily; let ſincerity be growing up towards perfection, and then it will be known what it is, <hi>Nichode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> will in a while, appear to be <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> an Iſraelite indeed in whom there is no guile.

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The pleaſure of ſucceſs.</hi> 'Tis a comfort to ſee ſomething coming in; <hi>when the deſire cometh, it is a tree of life;</hi> diſappointment is diſtreſs. To ask and not to have, to ſow and
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:103224:180"/>
not to reap, to work and not to have to eat, to buy, and ſell, and travail, and trade, and never to proſper in any thing, but to be as poor, and low, as thoſe that are idle; I need not tell you, how ſad and uncomfortable it is. To take upon us to be the Servants of Chriſt, to take up the profeſſing trade, the praying trade, and the hearing trade, and to find all we do, to come to juſt nothing; I have been praying, and hearing, and hoping, and yet ſtill I am where I was; Luſt holds up the head, Grace hangs the wing; doubts and fears, dulneſs and darkneſs ſtill abide upon me as heretofore, I am as carnal, and earthly, and barren, as very a child in Religion, as I was many years ſince; O what a weary and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable life is this! to have ſo many things a doing, and nothing done; O how heartleſs a thing is it.</p>
                  <p>When we have good ſucceſs, when we ſee our Souls proſpering, this will waſh our ſteps with butter, and ſtrew our wayes with roſe-buds, and make pleaſant all our paths.</p>
                  <p>One of the great joyes of the world, is the joy of the Harveſt; and the joy of the Saints is expreſs'd by that, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.3. <hi>They joy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, according to the joy in harveſt.</hi> The Harveſt is the ſucceſs of mens labours, and that's their joy, to ſee they have not laboured in vain.</p>
                  <p>Chriſtians, though they are never like in this life, to ſee the Harveſt in the ſheaf, yet 'tis a joy to them to ſee an Harveſt in the
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:103224:181"/>
blade; to perceive that the ſeed is not dead and rotten under the clods, but ſpringing up to the Harveſt; this is a pleaſant ſight. It is not ſuch a pleaſure to the Husbandman, to walk through his fields, where he hath been ploughing and ſowing, and to behold the thriving beginnings of an hopeful crop, to ſee all green, and freſh, and hearty, and ſtrong, this is not ſuch a pleaſure to the Husbandman, as 'tis to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, to ſee a ſpring of Grace in his Soul.</p>
                  <p>Now I ſee, 'tis not in vain to ſow to the ſpirit, to ſerve and wait on God. Where is all thy praying, where is all thy labouring? God knows where 'tis ſaith the barren Soul, I doubt 'tis all loſt, I can ſee no ſign of it remaining; that's a ſad Soul. But ask thus of the thriving Chriſtian, where is all thy praying, and thy labouring? and he can anſwer, O I thank God, 'tis here to be ſeen; This field of mine, a few years ſince, lay all fallow, rough, and hard, and nothing that was good, was to be found upon it; but now, (O how it joyes mine heart to find it ſo) the good ſeed that hath been bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried here, is not dead, 'tis gotten up above ground, the Lord hath let me ſee ſomething of his grace breaking forth, and it encreaſes and grows up daily in me. The hard and ſtubborn, is now become a melting and broken heart, the proud and froward, is now become an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and quiet ſpirit; It hath coſt me ſomething, many a ſad thought, many a ſigh, many a tear; but though I came hardly by it, here 'tis by the grace of God, the barren hath brought forth, this dry tree hath bloſſomed, this ſluggiſh heart,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:103224:181"/>
to which the very thoughts of a laborious fruitful life, were once ſo irkſome, that I doubted that I ſhould never have come to any thing, but ſhould have liv'd and died a drone; O what a comfort it is to me to ſee it thus hopefully come on. A diligent Chriſtian will have ſuch ſucceſſes, his <hi>labour ſhall not be in vain in the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.58. and when he ſees what good ſucceſs he has, then let him ſpeak, what a pleaſure it is to him.</p>
                  <p>Chriſtian, Thou haſt been at thy work, but what fruit haſt thou found? haſt thou proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered? haſt thou ſped well? doſt thou ſee of the travail of thy Soul? Is thy ſin weakened? is the world conquered, is grace quickened in thee? Is it ſo, and is it not a pleaſure to thee to find it ſo? Doth it not pleaſe thee, that thou art not ſo vain, nor ſo earthly, nor ſo proud as thou haſt been? Doth it not glad thee at the heart, to find that the Lord hath been with thee, and bleſſed thee, and helped thee, in what thou haſt ſet thine heart unto? And how lookeſt thou now, on thy remaining works? wilt thou any more drive ſo heartleſſely, and ſo heavily on, as thou waſt wont to do? wilt thou any more cry out, <hi>Hard ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice? a weary life?</hi> Sure thou canſt not; what thou findeſt coming in, will make thy very la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and thy ſweat, to be ſweetneſs to thee.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The pleaſure of Eaſe.</hi> Eaſe hath a pleaſure in it; not only eaſe or reſt from our work, but eaſe in our work, when we can carry it on with eaſe; by how much the harder our work is in it ſelf, by ſo much the greater pleaſures will it
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:103224:182"/>
be, when we can go eaſily through it. Chriſt tells us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.30. that his yoke is eaſie, and his burthen light. Chriſt's yoke is an hard and an heavy yoke to Sinners, and ſuch which they are in no wiſe able to bear, but he makes it eaſie to his Saints. A yoke may be made eaſie three wayes,
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>By making the burthen of it lighter,</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>By making the neck ſtronger,</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. <hi>By accuſtoming the neck to the yoke.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>By making the burthen of it lighter;</hi> by paring it, or taking off ſomething of it; a great yoke may be pared, and pared, till at length it come to be a little on. Thus Chriſt's yoke, will not be made eaſier; he will pare nothing off, he will not abate any thing of his work; there's the ſame Law for Saints and for Sinners, there's the ſame duty impos'd on the weak as the ſtrong, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.17, 18. <hi>Think not that I am come to deſtroy the Law or the Prophets, till Heaven and Earth paſs, one jott or title ſhall in no wiſe paſs from the Law, till all be fulfilled:</hi> The ſame Law which was from the beginning, ſhall be Law to the end. Chriſt will never make that to be no ſin, which once was ſin, nor that to be no duty which once was a duty, nor will he ever diſpenſe with duty or ſin; he ſays not to any, leſs ſhall ſerve for thee, than for others, he requires all of every one. But here, by way of caution, take notice of two things,</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="385" facs="tcp:103224:182"/>1. <hi>Chriſt's yoke, is in this ſenſe, eaſier than</hi> Moſes'<hi>s yoke,</hi> there is an abatement of the burthen of Ceremonies, and legal Rites; that Law of the <hi>carnal Commandment,</hi> as 'tis call'd, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.16. is vaniſhed, and taken out of the way; no more of that chargeable ſervice, of Sacrifices, no more Bulls, or Goats, or Lambs out of our flocks or herds; the ſervice of Chriſtians, is in this reſpect, cheaper Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, than that of the Jews of old, 'tis only our <hi>Moralls,</hi> whereof nothing will be abated.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Though Chriſt requires the ſame duty of all, and impoſes the ſame things, and as much upon the weak as upon the ſtrong, yet he will accept that of the weak, which he will not from the ſtrong.</hi> Nothing leſs than <hi>perfection,</hi> is due from the weakeſt, but <hi>ſincerity</hi> will be accepted, whatever im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection there be. God will take thoſe weak and maimed Services from the weak, which he will not from the ſtrong. He that hath a Male in his flock, and Sacrificeth a corrupt thing, Curſed be that deceiver, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.14.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>By making the neck ſtronger.</hi> That's an eaſie yoke to a man, which a Child is not able to wagge. A labouring man that's weak and ſickly, will find his ordinary work, to be too hard for him; when he recovers his ſtrength, he can go through it with eaſe.
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:103224:183"/>
Weak Chriſtians, will ever find Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to be hard Service; as they grow up to be ſtronger, they will find it grow more eaſie, day by day.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>By accuſtoming the neck to the yoke.</hi> The yoke at firſt putting on wrings and galls, and wearies; thoſe that are unaccuſtomed to the yoke, are impatient of the yoke, 'tis uſe that makes it eaſie. An Apprentice to a Trade, though at his firſt entrance, he do not half ſo much work as afterward; yet 'tis with twice ſo much pains. The firſt hour is ordinarily with him the burthen and heat of the day, his morning is hotter than his noon.</p>
                  <p>The tediouſneſs of Religion meets us at the threſhold, our hardeſt task is to begin well; nature will make the ſtrongeſt oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition againſt grace, at the the very birth of the new creature; our firſt charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt luſt, is uſually the hotteſt charge; the travail of the birth hath more pain in it, than all the after care of bringing up the child.</p>
                  <p>A Chriſtian at his firſt ſetting out after Chriſt, feels all his motions heavenward to be as ſwimming againſt the ſtream, but by how much the more, grace hath over-powred nature, by ſo much the more, he hath now gotten the ſtream with him; his following
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:103224:183"/>
God is now become as ſwimming down the ſtream of that new nature, which hath now gotten ſo much the better in him.</p>
                  <p>One of the hardeſt works of a Chriſtian, is <hi>Self-denyal;</hi> to lay down our own wills, to curb our appetites, to go croſs to our own diſpoſitions, intereſts, and humours; this goes near at firſt, and will hardly be born; but after we have us'd our ſelves a while to it, and by degrees inur'd our wills to ſubmiſſion to the will of Chriſt, and holding the bridle ſtrait upon luſt, and appetite, have made our hearts to feel themſelves to be under authority; a chearful and contented ſubjection will in time become habitual to us; the more ſelf-denyal we have exerciſed, the leſs will there be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards needed. He that hath been given to intemperance, to gluttony, or drunkenneſs, at his firſt laying a reſtraint upon himſelf, what a bondage is ſobriety and temperance to him? but after he hath uſed himſelf to a temperate life, he finds it more ſweet and eaſie to him, and is better pleas'd with it than ever he was with his former exceſs, and ſcarcely knows now, what 'tis to luſt after his old licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>Now Brethren, that which I would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you to is, Make your Religion plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, by making it eaſie to you; make your Religion eaſie, not by halfing your work,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:103224:184"/>
or remitting your care, but by increaſing your ſtrength and your diligence; get your hearts ſtrengthened, and get them habituated to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; this will make it eaſie, and eaſe will make it pleaſant.</p>
                  <p>What's the reaſon that we ſee ſome Sinners go on with ſo much pleaſure, in their wicked wayes? the ſervice of ſin is laborious enough, and in ſome reſpects much more toilſome and expenſive, than the Service of Chriſt; They have many Maſters to ſerve, and every one of them will be calling them to work; they have the Devil to ſerve, and the World to ſerve, and divers luſts to ſerve; they are like a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of men, who is at the command of more Maſters than one; one calls him this way, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that way, one hath this to be done, another that to be done; ſo that for one and another, the poor Servant can never be at reſt; ſuch is the caſe of Sinners, their pride calls them one way, their covetouſneſs another, their ſenſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity another; their Souls are made meer Hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys of, though they change their rider, yet one or other is ſtill upon their backs. And yet we ſee how roundly, and merrily they go on their way, without ever complaining of their Maſters, or their work. When do you ever hear any ſuch complaints among them, O this Devil is an hard Maſter, O this fleſh of mine, what a Tyrant is it? O this feaſting and ſporting, this drinking and rioting, what an irkſome Trade is it? O this getting of Money, this laying
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:103224:184"/>
houſe to houſe, and field to field, I am quite weary of it. When do you hear any ſuch groanings, or complainings amongſt them? No, no, they are ſtrong Sinners, they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to do wickedly, and thereupon, as very a drudgery as the ſervice of Sin is, they can go through it with eaſe, and pleaſure. Friends, get you to be ſtrong in the Lord, and you will run your race of duty with much more pleaſure, than ſinners run their courſe of iniquity, hold you cloſe to your work a while, and you will get to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with as much eaſe, as Sinners go to Hell.</p>
                  <p>O what fools are loytering, trifling Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans! who think to make their life eaſie, by idleneſs? what's the reaſon that thou halteſt thus after the Lord, and art ſo ſlothful in thy way? why doſt thou not ſet thine heart, and thy ſhoulders to the work of the Lord, and give thy ſelf in good earneſt, and wholly to it? O I can't endure all labour, all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, I muſt have a little eaſe; 'tis too tedious and painful to me, to hold to ſuch cloſe and conſtant ſervice. But doſt thou think to make thy work eaſie, by trifling at it? Fooliſh Soul, thou takeſt the ready way, to create thee the more difficulty; once the work muſt be done, or thou art undone, and there's no ſuch way to do it eaſily, as by doing it diligently; the life of a trifler, is the hardeſt life of all that profeſs themſelves

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>The pleaſure of Love.</hi> He that hath not felt pleaſures in love, hath not felt what 'tis to love. This is one of the great pleaſures of Heaven, to love and to be beloved; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the over-flowings of the divine love, and to feel our hearts emptying themſelves and flowing forth in returns of love to God. Look how much you have of love, ſo much of Heaven, of the joy that is above, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Whom having not ſeen, ye love;</hi> what follows? <hi>Ye rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and full of glory,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.16. <hi>God is love, and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God;</hi> and he that dwelleth in God, dwelleth in joy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.4. <hi>Delight thy ſelf in the Lord,</hi> to love God and to delight in God, are much the ſame, love is the bud, and delight is the bloſſome, that grows out of it.</p>
                  <p>Love hath a pleaſure in it, and the love of God, will put a pleaſure into all Religion. <hi>How amiable are thy Tabernacles, O Lord of Hoſts,</hi> Pſal. 84.1. <hi>It is good for me to draw near to God,</hi> Pſal. 73.28, <hi>I delight to do thy will, O my God,</hi> Pſal. 40.8. <hi>Sing praiſes to his name, for it is pleaſant,</hi> Pſal. 135.3. It is a pleaſant thing for him that loves, to pleaſe and praiſe the Lord; <hi>It is good before the Saints,</hi> Pſal. 52.9.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="391" facs="tcp:103224:185"/>Fear often brings us upon Service, but 'tis love that ſweetens it, fear brings us on, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the dayes of our minority, and it ſhould do ſo, as I have already ſhewed, if love will not, fear muſt. We often pray, and read, and hear, and ſearch our hearts, and look to our wayes, becauſe we dare do no other; we ſtrive, and wreſtle, and watch, againſt ſin, and its luſts, againſt the world and its temptations, becauſe we are afraid what would become of us, if we ſhould not. 'Tis well that any thing will do, either love or hope, or fear; whatever it be, that will bring us upon our duty, that will keep us from iniquity, 'tis well that ſomething will do it: 'Tis better to pray, becauſe we are afraid to neglect it, than not to pray at all; 'tis better to keep a good Conſcience, becauſe we are afraid of an evil Conſcience, than to be licentious; whatever it be that brings us upon a conſciencious life, better ſo, than to be let alone to carnality and looſeneſs.</p>
                  <p>But yet ſtill, 'tis love that ſweetens, and thereby ſtrikes the great and moſt kindly ſtroke in all Religion. Fear brings us to Religion, as to our <hi>Phyſick;</hi> the ſick man hath no love to Phyſick, but yet he will take it, rather than dye; Love brings us to it as to <hi>our food,</hi> 'tis our meat and drink to do the will of God; eating and drinking, to the hungry and thirſty, are ſome of the great
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:103224:186"/>
pleaſures of life. Duties are the meat of Holy Souls, and they come unto them, with as great deſire, and are converſant in them, with as great delight as hungry bodies come to, and ſit at their meals, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.3. <hi>I ſate down under his ſhadow, and his fruit was ſweet to my taſte.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Weak believers are like ſickly men, neither Phyſick, nor food will reliſh with them; they muſt eat for neceſſity, they cannot live without ſomething of Religion; but were it not for neceſſity, they could almoſt as well let it all alone. 'Tis well that neceſſity will prevail, but whileſt they are thus forced on, how heavily do they drive, and how little muſt ſuffice them? too often, they come on to their duties like bears to the ſtake, and go off from them, as the Oxe from under the yoke.</p>
                  <p>But when thou loveſt, thy ſoul will enlarge, and reach forth with deſire, even after the higheſt pitch of Godlineſs; and thou wilt go freely and chearfully on, in all the exerciſes of it. Thou wilt not then ſay, may not leſs ſerve? thou wilt not ſay, may not leſs duty ſerve, becauſe thou canſt not ſay, may not leſs pleaſure ſerve? Every one would have as much pleaſure as he can, and therefore would'ſt thou have, as much holineſs as thou canſt; the more holy, the more pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="393" facs="tcp:103224:186"/>If thou loveſt, thou wilt not be for ſhort Duties, ſhort Prayers, ſhort Sermons, little ſnatches at Religion, thou wilt not be ſo ſoon weary at thy work; when are men weary of pleaſure? when do they uſe to ſay, I have pleaſant hours enough, ſunſhine dayes enough, O that my good dayes were over once! O that my dayes of darkneſs would come, and the years draw nigh, wherein I might ſay, I have no pleaſure in them! Every one is willing to live in delights, as much and as long as he can; when once we can ſay, <hi>the Lord is my delight,</hi> the next word will be, <hi>Let me dwell in the preſence of God for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſtians, let our Souls take the wing, and mount up towards this bleſſed ſtate; O how ſhort do the moſt of us fall, we have much ground to go, e're we ſhall get up to it. How is it with us in our ſecret converſes with God? are we glad when our retiring hours draw near? when we enter into our Cloſets, to meet with our beloved, do we there uſe to ſolace our ſelves with love? Is praying and praiſing our pleaſure? is communing with God, and with our own hearts, a delight? do our hearts uſe to ſay, <hi>It's good for me to be here?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And how is it with us in our ordinary courſe? what is the joy of our life? Is this it, that our life is a walking with God? have we no
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:103224:187"/>
good dayes, but our holy-dayes? are we never well, but when we can ſee and ſerve the Lord, and never amiſs, while we are ſo doing? do we not only judge, but feel that intimacy and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity in Heaven, is our only Heaven on earth? Lord how ſeldom, Lord how little is it thus with us?</p>
                  <p>But may we not obtain? Is not ſuch a bleſſed ſtate, worth our putting in for it? Are you willing, friends, to keep you alwayes at this diſtance from your delight? Is it enough, that you have ſome hopes for hereafter, are you content that your ſouls ſhould never taſte of your joyes here? ſhall they ſtill dwell in exile, while they dwell on earth? ſhall they never put off the garments of their widowhood, till they put off their clothing of fleſh? Are you content to take up yet longer, with this dark and diſconſolate ſtate? Is the drudgery of Religion, this ſighing, and mourning, and ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving againſt the ſtream, and going on ſo poor, and hungry, and hard beſtead; Is this Religion enough for you? would you be glad to be more cheary, and lively in your way? would you taſte the milk and the honey, the marrow and the fatneſs? would you ride on, with free ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and full ſails, triumphing over difficulties, and rejoycing in hope of the glory of God? would you that theſe rough wayes were become a plain, and theſe dark ſhades were all ſun-ſhine? would you feed in the green paſtures, and be led by the ſtill waters, and be made to drink of
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:103224:187"/>
that River, that makes glad the City of God? Then put you on, be no longer ſmatterers and pidlers, dwell no longer on the ſhoar or ſurface of Religion, but hoyſe up all your ſails, and launch forth into the deep; get you into the heart and inſide of Chriſtianity, where the Lord will ſhew you his loves. Be not ſatisfyed with ſome few glances, or little touches; but get you poſſeſſed and ſwallowed up of the love of God in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord; and this will be to you, both the wine, that will make glad your hearts; and the oyle, that will make all your wheels to run: then ſhall you run the way of Gods Commandements, when the pleaſure of Love ſhall enlarge your hearts.</p>
